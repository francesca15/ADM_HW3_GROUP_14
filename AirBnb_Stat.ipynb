This spacious house is perfect for family and friend gatherings. Take a stroll through the 12 acres of creek side nature (2 private, 10 shared with the owners), watch the deer graze as you enjoy your morning coffee, strum your guitar beside the fire pit, challenge your friends to a game of pool, watch your kiddos play in the tree house, have a family bbq on the gorgeous back deck, snuggle up by the fireplace with a cup of hot cocoa, and feel the stress of your daily life melt away.  The name Edelweiss belongs to a delicate white flower that grows in the Alps, made famous in The Sound of Music. From the morning songs of the sweet, chirping birds to the evening orchestra courtesy of the frogs and toads along the creek, we like to say that the Hill Country is alive with the sound of music! Here you get the privacy and serenity of a country home with all the amenities of modern life, including wifi. During the house remodel the kitchen was built from scratch, and some of the furniture was hand made by the owner, a professional woodworker. The house has two and a half baths, three bedrooms (king, queen, and three twin beds), plus a large game room with two queen futons, games for kids of all ages, and a pool table. Add that to the spacious living room with a fold-out couch, dining room with a table for 8, and the large deck with a beautiful hand-made picnic table, and you’ve got the perfect space for your family and friend retreat! At Edelweiss the owners are environmentally conscious. They offer full recycling, use environmentally friendly dish soap, provide recycled paper products, offer a reverse-osmosis filtration system to eliminate the need for bottled water, and landscape minimally with native low-water plants.   If you plan to visit in the summer with children, you might also be interested in enrolling in one of the owner’s fun art classes next door. Jennifer, a TX certified art teacher, offers the best creative summer camps for small, peaceful groups in her creek side studio. Check out her offerings for kids ages 6+ at Agua Fresca Studios.   We are confident that Edelweiss will exceed your expectations. Just read some of the comments from the previous guests. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as keeping the kitchen stocked with condiments and basics that you may have forgotten. When their chickens can keep up you’ll even find fresh, organic eggs in the fridge. You won’t want to leave Edelweiss, but you can always come back for another visit!   Pet policy: Pets allowed at $50 per pet and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended at the home that they be crated and that they remain on leash when outside the fenced yard if they might be inclined to chase a cat, chicken or child. Thanks!  This home sits on two private acres and we allow our guests as much privacy as possible. We also invite guests to explore our 10 shared acres next door, and are happy to strike up a conversation in passing. We love meeting new people!  There is a lovely creek view from the backyard, but the bank is steeper here and access down to the water is not super easy. There are multiple easy creek access points on the shared 10 acres, though. While our creek is a year 'round creek, our extended Texas drought has taken its toll on area springs and water levels can fluctuate during hot, dry spells.</td><td>Wimberley</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/434915?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX</td></tr><tr><td>Beautiful Creekside Country Home</td><td>Edelweiss is a lovely country home on the banks of beautiful Smith Creek, yet only minutes from the fabulous shopping and dining of downtown Wimberley.

They offer full recycling, use environmentally friendly dish soap, provide recycled paper products, offer a reverse-osmosis filtration system to eliminate the need for bottled water, and landscape minimally with native low-water plants.   If you plan to visit in the summer with children, you might also be interested in enrolling in one of the owner’s fun art classes next door. Jennifer, a TX certified art teacher, offers the best creative summer camps for small, peaceful groups in her creek side studio. Check out her offerings for kids ages 6+ at Agua Fresca Studios.   We are confident that Edelweiss will exceed your expectations. Just read some of the comments from the previous guests. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as keeping the kitchen stocked with condiments and basics that you may have forgotten. When their chickens can keep up you’ll even find fresh, organic eggs in the fridge. You won’t want to leave Edelweiss, but you can always come back for another visit!   Pet policy: Pets allowed at $50 per pet and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended at the home that they be crated and that they remain on leash when outside the fenced yard if they might be inclined to chase a cat, chicken or child. Thanks!  This home sits on two private acres and we allow our guests as much privacy as possible. We also invite guests to explore our 10 shared acres next door, and are happy to strike up a conversation in passing. We love meeting new people!  There is a lovely creek view from the backyard, but the bank is steeper here and access down to the water is not super easy. There are multiple easy creek access points on the shared 10 acres, though. While our creek is a year 'round creek, our extended Texas drought has taken its toll on area springs and water levels can fluctuate during hot, dry spells.</td><td>Wimberley</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/434915?location=Colorado%20River%2C%20TX</td></tr><tr><td>Beautiful Creekside Country Home</td><td>Edelweiss is a lovely country home on the banks of beautiful Smith Creek, yet only minutes from the fabulous shopping and dining of downtown Wimberley. This spacious house is perfect for family and friend gatherings. Take a stroll through the 12 acres of creek side nature (2 private, 10 shared with the owners), watch the deer graze as you enjoy your morning coffee, strum your guitar beside the fire pit, challenge your friends to a game of pool, watch your kiddos play in the tree house, have a family bbq on the gorgeous back deck, snuggle up by the fireplace with a cup of hot cocoa, and feel the stress of your daily life melt away.  The name Edelweiss belongs to a delicate white flower that grows in the Alps, made famous in The Sound of Music. From the morning songs of the sweet, chirping birds to the evening orchestra courtesy of the frogs and toads along the creek, we like to say that the Hill Country is alive with the sound of music! Here you get the privacy and serenity of a country home with all the amenities of modern life, including wifi. During the house remodel the kitchen was built from scratch, and some of the furniture was hand made by the owner, a professional woodworker. The house has two and a half baths, three bedrooms (king, queen, and three twin beds), plus a large game room with two queen futons, games for kids of all ages, and a pool table.

Are you enamored with the vintage style of a bygone era? Do you enjoy camping, but secretly wish you had a real bed, wifi and a bathroom? If so, the Dixie Daisy is for you! This cute Airstream trailer has been completely renovated with a retro twist. It’s the perfect place to escape for a relaxing weekend surrounded by nature, yet equipped with the conveniences of home. Grill up a yummy dinner with your honey and dine al fresco on the large deck, take a morning stroll along the creek, turn on the string lights for some mood lighting, take a dip in the hot tub, enjoy your morning shower under the trees in the private, spacious outdoor shower (room for two!), and end your day relaxing by the fire with an ice cold beer. This is the life!   The Dixie Daisy provides all the comforts of home in one cute, cozy package. The antique iron bedframe holds a queen mattress, the bathroom has a small interior shower and a real toilet, the kitchen is fully equipped with dishes and utensils, and alongside the deck is a charcoal grill and fire bowl for your night-time fire. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as leaving fresh eggs in the fridge (as long as the chickens keep up) and local organic coffee. They also strive to make this property as green as possible by using environmentally friendly dish soap and laundry detergent, providing recycled paper products and full recycling, using low-wattage light bulbs, and more.  This cozy retreat is nestled in an elm grove along the banks of Smith Creek on 10 beautiful acres shared with the owners. You’ll really feel like you’ve escaped to nature, yet the fabulous shopping and dining of downtown Wimberley are only 3 miles down the road. It’s the best of both worlds! So, what are you waiting for? The Dixie Daisy is the unique getaway you’ve been dreaming of. We are confident that it will exceed your expectations!  Pet policy: Pets are allowed for a fee of $50 per pet, and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended that they be crated and that they remain on leash when wandering the property if they might be inclined to chase a child, cat, or chicken or wander off. Thanks for understanding!  Single night bookings:  We have a two night minimum, but when there is a single night gap in the schedule we are happy to accept a single night booking for an additional $25. Just shoot us a message with your date and we'll go from there.  We strive to give our guests as much privacy as possible, but you may see us from time to time during your stay.
