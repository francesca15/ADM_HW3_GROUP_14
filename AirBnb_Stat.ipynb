This spacious house is perfect for family and friend gatherings. Take a stroll through the 12 acres of creek side nature (2 private, 10 shared with the owners), watch the deer graze as you enjoy your morning coffee, strum your guitar beside the fire pit, challenge your friends to a game of pool, watch your kiddos play in the tree house, have a family bbq on the gorgeous back deck, snuggle up by the fireplace with a cup of hot cocoa, and feel the stress of your daily life melt away.  The name Edelweiss belongs to a delicate white flower that grows in the Alps, made famous in The Sound of Music. From the morning songs of the sweet, chirping birds to the evening orchestra courtesy of the frogs and toads along the creek, we like to say that the Hill Country is alive with the sound of music! Here you get the privacy and serenity of a country home with all the amenities of modern life, including wifi. During the house remodel the kitchen was built from scratch, and some of the furniture was hand made by the owner, a professional woodworker. The house has two and a half baths, three bedrooms (king, queen, and three twin beds), plus a large game room with two queen futons, games for kids of all ages, and a pool table. Add that to the spacious living room with a fold-out couch, dining room with a table for 8, and the large deck with a beautiful hand-made picnic table, and you’ve got the perfect space for your family and friend retreat! At Edelweiss the owners are environmentally conscious. They offer full recycling, use environmentally friendly dish soap, provide recycled paper products, offer a reverse-osmosis filtration system to eliminate the need for bottled water, and landscape minimally with native low-water plants.   If you plan to visit in the summer with children, you might also be interested in enrolling in one of the owner’s fun art classes next door. Jennifer, a TX certified art teacher, offers the best creative summer camps for small, peaceful groups in her creek side studio. Check out her offerings for kids ages 6+ at Agua Fresca Studios.   We are confident that Edelweiss will exceed your expectations. Just read some of the comments from the previous guests. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as keeping the kitchen stocked with condiments and basics that you may have forgotten. When their chickens can keep up you’ll even find fresh, organic eggs in the fridge. You won’t want to leave Edelweiss, but you can always come back for another visit!   Pet policy: Pets allowed at $50 per pet and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended at the home that they be crated and that they remain on leash when outside the fenced yard if they might be inclined to chase a cat, chicken or child. Thanks!  This home sits on two private acres and we allow our guests as much privacy as possible. We also invite guests to explore our 10 shared acres next door, and are happy to strike up a conversation in passing. We love meeting new people!  There is a lovely creek view from the backyard, but the bank is steeper here and access down to the water is not super easy. There are multiple easy creek access points on the shared 10 acres, though. While our creek is a year 'round creek, our extended Texas drought has taken its toll on area springs and water levels can fluctuate during hot, dry spells.</td><td>Wimberley</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/434915?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX</td></tr><tr><td>Beautiful Creekside Country Home</td><td>Edelweiss is a lovely country home on the banks of beautiful Smith Creek, yet only minutes from the fabulous shopping and dining of downtown Wimberley.

I built the little house on the hill as a micro home; it has everything a home has in a very small package. I truly love this home and can’t wait to share it with you!  The Little House on the Hill has a beautiful country view and atmosphere just minutes from everything Austin has to offer.  The little house is a beautifully hand crafted 340 sq. ft. micro home built on top of a hill overlooking the south Austin skyline. The cottage can comfortably accommodate up to 2 adults. Inside there is a full kitchen, full-size loft bed, walk-in-shower, 40 inch flat screen TV with basic cable channels, sm. couch and small folding table and chair.   ********************PLEASE NOTE*********************** We DO NOT offer internet in the house, however we have fantastic LTE cell-phone service with most carriers (att, t-mobile, version, sprint) so that you can still enjoy internet through your smart phone. *****************************************************************  The kitchen has brand new stainless steel appliances, which include a microwave, gas oven and stove, refrigerator and reclaimed vintage cast iron sink set in a custom concrete counter top. Coffee maker, pots, pans, dishes and utensils are also included in the kitchen. There is also a pantry to store dry groceries. We do not have a dish washer so you will be responsible for washing your dishes before leaving. Caffeinated coffee, creamer and sweetener are also included for your enjoyment.   The bathroom is full size and includes a large walk in shower with overhead lighting. The restroom is NOT separated by a door, therefore, minimal privacy is available while using the restroom facilities. This is a one room cottage; you will not want to stay here with someone you are not comfortable with, there is NO door for the toilet. Very open concept. Hand towels, bath towels, washcloths, toilet paper and hand soap are included during your stay. Please bring your own toiletries.  Beside the bathroom and under the loft bed is a designated closet area which includes a cabinet for folded clothes, and a clothes rod for hanging garments. ABOVE the closet area is the full size bed, with a comfy foam mattress. Two alternative-down pillows and linens are provided. The bed is 7 feet in the air and therefore, a ladder is used to access the bed, gaurd rails are set on either side of the bed for your added safety. In addition, the clearance above the bed is only 3 feet so it's very cozy.  The living room is simple with a sm. Ikea couch (not meant for sleeping unfortunately), a flat screen TV with basic local cable along with a small folding desk and single chair area for any working needs.    A rear patio/deck with an amazing view of south Austin is included in your stay. A back patio for your enjoyment outdoors with dining table and chairs.   *********************PLEASE NOTE********************** If you are considering traveling with your pet, I apologize we are NO LONGER ALLOW PETS.  *****************************************************************  Smoking is NOT allowed inside the cabin, however you may step outside of the cabin onto the patio and enjoy lovely views and peaceful feelings are free.  I do work on the property in a workshop on the acreage with 2 other employees most days of the week, I own my own company. I'm also in the process of building a home for our family along with another micro home. I have a german sheperd, Heidi who often accompanies me on work days. Please do not be afraid of her though, she is extremely friendly, but does have a big bark :) I also have a fiancé Rachel, and son who are often on the property, we are building for our homesite. My fiancé also has 3 dogs, all of which are friendly and range in size but are all loving rescue pups.

This spacious house is perfect for family and friend gatherings. Take a stroll through the 12 acres of creek side nature (2 private, 10 shared with the owners), watch the deer graze as you enjoy your morning coffee, strum your guitar beside the fire pit, challenge your friends to a game of pool, watch your kiddos play in the tree house, have a family bbq on the gorgeous back deck, snuggle up by the fireplace with a cup of hot cocoa, and feel the stress of your daily life melt away.  The name Edelweiss belongs to a delicate white flower that grows in the Alps, made famous in The Sound of Music. From the morning songs of the sweet, chirping birds to the evening orchestra courtesy of the frogs and toads along the creek, we like to say that the Hill Country is alive with the sound of music! Here you get the privacy and serenity of a country home with all the amenities of modern life, including wifi. During the house remodel the kitchen was built from scratch, and some of the furniture was hand made by the owner, a professional woodworker. The house has two and a half baths, three bedrooms (king, queen, and three twin beds), plus a large game room with two queen futons, games for kids of all ages, and a pool table. Add that to the spacious living room with a fold-out couch, dining room with a table for 8, and the large deck with a beautiful hand-made picnic table, and you’ve got the perfect space for your family and friend retreat! At Edelweiss the owners are environmentally conscious. They offer full recycling, use environmentally friendly dish soap, provide recycled paper products, offer a reverse-osmosis filtration system to eliminate the need for bottled water, and landscape minimally with native low-water plants.   If you plan to visit in the summer with children, you might also be interested in enrolling in one of the owner’s fun art classes next door. Jennifer, a TX certified art teacher, offers the best creative summer camps for small, peaceful groups in her creek side studio. Check out her offerings for kids ages 6+ at Agua Fresca Studios.   We are confident that Edelweiss will exceed your expectations. Just read some of the comments from the previous guests. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as keeping the kitchen stocked with condiments and basics that you may have forgotten. When their chickens can keep up you’ll even find fresh, organic eggs in the fridge. You won’t want to leave Edelweiss, but you can always come back for another visit!   Pet policy: Pets allowed at $50 per pet and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended at the home that they be crated and that they remain on leash when outside the fenced yard if they might be inclined to chase a cat, chicken or child. Thanks!  This home sits on two private acres and we allow our guests as much privacy as possible. We also invite guests to explore our 10 shared acres next door, and are happy to strike up a conversation in passing. We love meeting new people!  There is a lovely creek view from the backyard, but the bank is steeper here and access down to the water is not super easy. There are multiple easy creek access points on the shared 10 acres, though. While our creek is a year 'round creek, our extended Texas drought has taken its toll on area springs and water levels can fluctuate during hot, dry spells.</td><td>Wimberley</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/434915?location=Colorado%20River%2C%20TX</td></tr><tr><td>Beautiful Creekside Country Home</td><td>Edelweiss is a lovely country home on the banks of beautiful Smith Creek, yet only minutes from the fabulous shopping and dining of downtown Wimberley.
