Your own Parking spot can be found in front of the house on the granite gravel driveway just beside the mailbox.   The bedroom available in this listing accommodates two persons on a queen bed. It is next to my study and craft room that sometimes serves as another guest room for a family member or friend but rarely list on airbnb unless there is a huge need (SXSW, ACL, etc.). This room listing is my primary listing but wanted you to be aware of the 2nd bedroom that may be occasionally occupied by another guest. The bathroom is in the hallway and would be a shared bath with whomever stays in the 2nd guest room (if any). Otherwise, it's all yours.   The room has central air/heat and I also have a ceiling fan and a small space heater/fan for your own temperature control within the room. There is a Queen-sized bed (fresh linens, comforter and pillows provided), basic toiletries if needed, basic cable tv, a closet, desk, small microwave oven and secure wireless internet throughout the house.   Nearby (by car) there are plenty of restaurants, grocery stores, dry cleaners, and a mall. A nice park is within walking distance with picnic area, tennis/volleyball court and a walking trail. We have the Alamo Drafthouse movie theatre just over 2 miles away and the Lakeline Shopping Mall.  Transportation: Your own vehicle transportation is probably best because of the location. MetroRail station is about 2-1/2 miles from the house if you prefer to leave your car parked in their lot and have the train take you to the heart of downtown.   We're non-smokers and prefer to host non-smokers, but if you don't mind disposing of your cigarettes properly outside, we will consider. Even though we're busy hosts we enjoy meeting new people and answering any questions. So if you're a friendly individual or at least know to say hello when you see us in the common areas, we would love to host you!   -------------------------------------------------  Gravel Parking Kitchen  We interact with our guests as little or as much as needed.  Quiet neighborhood with lots of trees and good neighbors.  We are approximately 16 miles from downtown Austin. When not traveling during rush hour, I can get to downtown Austin in about 25 minutes but during rush hour, it can take up to an hour. My location makes it easier for guests with their own mode of transportation but if needed, approximately 2 miles away is the train station which will get you downtown. The bus is approximately 1.2 miles from the house but sometimes it takes over an hour and a half for the bus to make its way downtown.</td><td>Austin</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5769?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX</td></tr><tr><td>The Wild, Wild West Dallas Backpacker's B&B - 2</td><td>Yeehaw!! .........

    "- *zone (zone_u)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average price per night**: we simply use average price per night from the tsv files and from this variable any house can get at maximum 2 points and at least 0. Maximum number of points (2) is achieved if the price is lower than half of the price suggested by the user, instead if price is two times the requested price the house get 0. To get 1 point you need to have the same price or lower than 1.25 times the suggested price. Naturally, other intermediate marks can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n° of bedrooms**: if the n° of bedrooms requested are more or the same, house gets 1 point; if there are less bedrooms, house gets a lower mark. If there are three bedrooms less than requested or worse, house gets 0 point. \n",
    "\n",
    "**zone**: We found a set of coordinates (31,169621, -99,683617) that can be considered the center of texas; that is near to the city of Brady (County of McCulloch), so we divided Texas in four zones according to this center (like a cartesian coordinate system). Zones are: North East (NE), North West (NW), South East (SE) and South West (SW). If the house is in the requested zone it gets 1 point else 0. Is important to clarify that we didn't use cities because, given the fact that there are cities with the same name in different counties (e.g. we have 3 Austin), we can't use them because they can be confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we can calculate the Score as sum/4 where sum is sum of the accomulated scores from individul fields based on user choices and 4 is maximum number points that can be accumulated."
