$500	4	Boliver peninsula	January 2017	Enjoy waking up from any bedroom with a view of the ocean. Have your coffee on the balcony of your bedroom or downstairs in a large den full of Windows with ocean views. There are 3 bedrooms upstairs that share a balcony with an unobstructed view of the Ocean. Downstairs has a wall of windows that also has an unobstructed view of the Ocean. The house is located in an upscale subdivision in Crystal beach. In Crystal beach you can rent golf carts to drive on the beach which is why I chose Crystal beach instead of Galveston.	29.4729465747327	-94.589737154473	Beautiful large Beach Front House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17567301?location=Anahuac%2C%20TX
