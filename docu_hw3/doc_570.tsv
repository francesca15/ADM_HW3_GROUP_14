$349	4	Fort Worth	January 2016	This house is so much fun, very peaceful, great views, beautiful sunset walks and sunrise runs! Great to have coffee and sit outside family-friendly activities, and art and culture. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the comfy bed, the coziness, the kitchen, lake, pool, outdoor kitchen and fireplace, hiking trails, marina, horse trails. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	32.6315830993873	-97.48943983369949	Beautiful funhouse 5 min from lake w/pool	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14215084?location=Benbrook%2C%20TX
