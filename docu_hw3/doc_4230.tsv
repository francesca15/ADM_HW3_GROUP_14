$59	1	San Antonio	September 2015	My place is close to parks, great views, restaurants, and dining. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the kitchen, the high ceilings, the coziness, and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families with kids, and furry friends. We have a friendly furry friend of our own to meet yours!  We have a ping pong table, a large entertainment center with couches and Netflix, a great patio for coffee, a playstation with video games, and a phenomenal kitchen! :)	29.5898688959686	-98.4264958716918	Cozy Room at Cozy Casa!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15765643?location=Converse%2C%20TX
