$175	Studio	Wimberley	March 2012	The Moonshiner Cabin is a perfectly curated, hand-built treasure. Let it transport you back in time to an era of cocktails and jazz. The owners have lovingly curated this cabin using The Prohibition Era and a bit of Steampunk as inspiration and we guarantee thereâ€™s nothing else like it! Just a short jaunt to town, yet nestled amongst the oaks on 1.5 private acres, this cabin has everything you require of modern life, but the charm and romance of a different century.	29.980840372996397	-98.0914874742849	The Moonshiner: Prohibition with a Steampunk Twist	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14139186?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
