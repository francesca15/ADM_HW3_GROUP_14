$70	1	Fort Worth	February 2015	My place is close to restaurants and dining, family-friendly activities downtown Fort Worth Hulen Mall Burleson, TX . Youâ€™ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the neighborhood, and the ambiance. This space is good for couples and solo adventurers. I am not off the bus line but Uber or lyft can take you right up the street about 3 miles to the nearest stop if necessary. The queen size bed has memory foam topping for a very soft bed. I have 2 small trained dogs that are friendly and clean.	32.6306742733641	-97.30344102708479	Cozy space with all the essentials	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13804014?location=Burleson%2C%20TX
