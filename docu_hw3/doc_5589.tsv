$200	2	Wimberley	June 2016	Our home shares a border with the Jacob's Well Natural Area and the walk to the swimming hole from our front porch is closer than the walk from the parking lot. Come stay the night before your park reservations and wake up at 'The Well' or make lunch and take a nap after you swim.  Youâ€™ll love our place because of clean country air, birds singing in the trees, deer grazing in the yard, crickets singing you to sleep and the potable tap water that comes straight from the pristine aquifer below.	30.036264722832797	-98.1287528818216	Jacob's Well Acres	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13725058?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
