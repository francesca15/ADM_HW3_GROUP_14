$200	3	Bryan	July 2016	Quiet, wooded, culdesak neighborhood with a circle driveway for lots of parking and a spacious shaded backyard.  The convenient central location makes getting to Downtown Bryan or Texas A&amp;M University a breeze. Enjoy watching fireflies and bunnies from the back patio and deck. There's a fenced section in the back for dogs and play fort area for kids. A great escape that gives you the nearby city perks with a relaxing out-of-town feel.	30.6204156355575	-96.38297106462808	Large, shaded yard near TAMU	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14088871?location=College%20Station%2C%20TX
