$92	2	San Antonio	April 2017	Stay only 10 minutes away from downtown in the heart of Deco district which is filled with beautiful historic homes in well established neighborhoods. We are located 2 minutes away from Woodlawn Park and Minutes away from Fredricksburg, Babcock, and Medical Center. More attractions include a short 22 minute drive to Six Flags Fiesta Texas or Sea World. We are surrounded by Mom &amp; Pop shops and close to malls. But far enough to offer a very peaceful and quiet home.  We live right upstairs :).	29.4637867694439	-98.5465657772353	Jefferson Heights Art Deco Retreat	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18042717?location=Bulverde%2C%20TX
