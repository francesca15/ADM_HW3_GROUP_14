$80	1	Austin	May 2017	My Del Valle home is a short 5 minutes away from the Formula 1 Racetrack &amp; Austin360 Amphitheater, 10 minutes from the Austin Bergstrom Airport, and 15-20 minutes from Downtown Austin. I live on a very quiet street, perfect after a long day of exploring Austin. Plenty of parking space and you will be treated to breakfast, tea, and coffee in the morning! My place is good for singles and couples who are looking for a home away from home.	30.1663303098216	-97.6260662092591	5 minutes from F1/Austin360, 15 min from Airport	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18491691?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
