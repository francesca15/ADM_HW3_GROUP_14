$275	4	McKinney	April 2017	Thank you for your interest in our home, located in McKinneyâ€™s historic district. The house was built in 1897 and is listed on the historic registry. Ryan grew up in this home and purchased it from his parents in 2013. We spent 4 years renovating the home, finding ways to incorporate original details into an improved layout. The original back porch was restored and many historic features were found from other historic homes, such as the porch spindles, stained glass windows and corbels.	33.196068640376204	-96.6274670247926	Runge Range Holiday Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18249443?location=Allen%2C%20TX
