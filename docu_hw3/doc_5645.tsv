$884	3	Canyon Lake	December 2016	DEER CANYON VISTAS - a SkyRun Texas Property    Come enjoy Deer Canyon Vistas, complete with multiple decks, hot tub, and panoramic views of Canyon Lake!   Deer Canyon Vistas is nestled on a hillside overlooking Canyon Lake, and is the perfect place for family and friends to relax and reconnect. When you arrive at the home, some might choose to prop up their feet on one of several decks and take in the views of the blue water, while others will be ready to jump right in! Either way, Deer Canyon has you covered, since the home rests only steps from water access at the free county boat ramp, where you can also swim to your heart's content since the vast limestone shorelines are publicly owned.  Back inside, you'll find a completely remodeled interior with comfortable furnishings, tasteful decorations, and the square footage needed to spread out and relax. The master bedroom upstairs features a king bed, full bath with separate vanity area, TV, and private deck, perfect for two. The second and third bedrooms each have queen beds and share the hall bath with a large walk-in shower. If you choose to dine in, you'll certainly want to use the gas grill or prepare that special vacation meal from the fully equipped kitchen. When the sun goes down, don't forget the large hot tub with ample lake views and cool Hill Country breezes, far away from the hustle and bustle of the daily grind.  Deer Canyon Vistas is also conveniently located only five minutes from the Guadalupe River and numerous river outfitters, and is a twenty minute drive into New Braunfels where you'll find world- famous Schlitterbahn, two-stepping at Gruene Hall, authentic German food, and much more.
