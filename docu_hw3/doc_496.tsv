$40	1	San Antonio	December 2012	This unique private guest room at the Gold House offers the amenities of home in a city full of things to do! The entire downstairs living room, kitchen, and dining area is open to guests. Come on down to SA town and experience Texan hospitality for yourself!  Please note: there is a second guest room at the Gold house, so if this listing is booked, do check with me to see if the second room is available! Thanks for your interest!   Cute House: It's a private room upstairs with a full bed, small desk, walk-in closet, Ironing Board, and en suite bathroom. The window has a nice view of the back yard and wooded easement. The back yard is large with a little garden in the back. The kitchen was recently renovated with nice granite counter tops and new appliances. Also, there is a brand new running/hiking trail one mile away. Parking is safe and free in the form of my driveway.  More than Two People? No problem: There is a second guestroom in the loft with a full bed that can be reserved via my other listing. http://airbnb.com/rooms/826725  Breakfast/Snacks: The living room/dining room/patio/kitchen are all fair game for guests. Breakfast is provided by way of oatmeal and any items found on the counter (Hot tea and coffee too).   Four-Legged Friends:  I do have two wonderful dogs (lab and husky), but don't worry they aren't allowed upstairs. They stay outside during the day, and sleep in their beds downstairs at night. They are both full of sugar - but if you have a fear of dogs then this place is not for you(URL HIDDEN) Location: It is literally right next to a brand new grocery store but you wouldn't know it from the back yard. It is 10-15 minutes from La Cantera - the gorgeous outdoor shopping mall. As well as Six Flags Fiesta Texas and UTSA. It is 5-10 minutes from the medical center area where all the hospitals are. It is 3 miles from IH-10, which is the main highway to get to downtown where the Riverwalk is (about 20 minutes by car). Airport - about 15-20 minutes away.   Things to look up for your trip regardless of whether you choose the Gold House for your stay (we want you to have fun!):  In San Antonio... - The Riverwalk  - Market Square - The Spanish Missions (Includes the Alamo of course...you can rent bikes to explore all of them!) - Six Flags Fiesta Texas Theme Park - Sea World Theme Park - Morgan's Wonderland (Special Needs Theme Park) - San Antonio Botanical Gardens - San Antonio Zoo  Within an Hour of San Antonio... - Schlitterbahn Water Park (Amazing rides, Bring Food, and Free Parking) - Natural Bridge Caverns (wondrous caves to stay cool) - Natural Bridge Wildlife Ranch (African Safari Texas Style) - Gruene, Texas (adorable hill country town with shopping and tubing on the river)   The entire downstairs!
