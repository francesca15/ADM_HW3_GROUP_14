$36	1	Austin	March 2016	My place is close to parks, public transport, moon tower saloon, strange brew, farmers market on sat. morning. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the comfy bed (queen organic cotton w/ tempur-pedic topper), the ambiance, the outdoor space, non toxic indoor air. My place is good for solo adventurers and business travelers.	30.1829391643117	-97.8014689593101	You can have the red room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13361970?location=Austin%2C%20TX
