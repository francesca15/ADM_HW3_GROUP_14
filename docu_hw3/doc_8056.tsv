$130	2	Wimberley	June 2013	A cabin in the woods, sitting in the middle of nowhere, it seems. Less than 20 minutes drive to downtown Wimberley. 15 minutes to Jacob's Well. You can hear the birds sing during the day and see the stars so close at night. This is a great place to get away from the busy Austin and just be with yourself and nature. It is great for kids and pets. The kitchen is fully equipped with all you need to cook. Pets are allowed but please let us know. Please read other things to note before booking.	30.1098047073161	-98.2503938694691	Wimberley Cabin in the Woods	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17574849?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
