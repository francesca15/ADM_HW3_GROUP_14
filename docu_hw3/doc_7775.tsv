$30	1	Grand Prairie	July 2015	We are close to all the entertainment locations in Arlington/Grand Prairie - Cowboy and Ranger Stadiums, Lone Star Park, Six Flags, Hurricane Harbor, Wax Museum, etc. Tons of restaurants and easy access to the DFW Airport.  This is my home with my wife and three sons as well as two long term to international students so I require extra disclosure for our safety. Please include details about your personal bio, AirBnB experience, and purpose of visit with request. Thanks for understanding.	32.777387283196894	-97.038498923817	Grand Prairie - close to Arlington & DFW Airport	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13358215?location=Cedar%20Hill%2C%20TX
