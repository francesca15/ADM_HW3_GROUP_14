$300	3	Austin	May 2012	Boutique style craftsman in the heart of East Austin. Just a few blocks away from the East 11th and East 6th districts. Very near downtown - a short walk or incredibly short car ride away. One of the best possible locations in Austin - close to the airport, in the middle of SXSW festivities, a short walk to the UT football and baseball stadiums, and just a stone's throw from cafes and nightlife.	30.2721463221062	-97.71917212249349	Boutique Style in Hip East Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/628034?location=Brazos%20River%2C%20TX
