$39	1	Dallas	February 2015	Close to restaurants, nightlife, and public transport (DART). It's cozy and the location is stellar! Master bed/bath with semi-private entry. Directly behind us is a convenience store and across the street there is another conv. store specializing in Mexican produce and items. They make fresh tortillas daily to go! The neighbor living in the old church (they converted to a mansion) is an inventor, if you ask me I'll tell you who lives in it, but if you do some googling you may find out yourself!	32.799489638446396	-96.75569623514392	Clean, Private and Secure For Business or Casual	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14484183?location=Carrollton%2C%20TX
