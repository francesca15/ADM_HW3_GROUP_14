$106	Studio	Boerne	July 2012	Our place is close to family-friendly activities (less than 5 minutes from downtown Boerne, 20 minutes from tubing on the Guadalupe River, 15 minutes from Boerne Lake, 35 minutes to Sea World, 20 minutes to Fiesta Texas), and the airport (30 minutes from SAT). Youâ€™ll love my place because of the Texas Hill Country views, the proximity to town, yet you feel out in the country (we are on 5 acres - not in a development), the outdoors space (pool, hot tub, outdoor shower, fire pit).	29.7559075949681	-98.74641757318778	Texas Hill Country Farm House (Guest Quarters)	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13586701?location=Boerne%2C%20TX
