$60	1	Fort Worth	June 2016	My place has a spare cozy quiet room with a queen size bed, Upstairs sitting area with Tv and Wifi. Yoll love my place because its Close to I-35W, a mile to Burleson Mall and 15minutes to downtown Fort Worth. There is also lots of restaurants, gyms and parks. The neighborhood is so quiet, suitable to relax, catch up with your work and have a good rest. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	32.5970121961794	-97.3232354840238	Private room in a quiet home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13659814?location=Burleson%2C%20TX
