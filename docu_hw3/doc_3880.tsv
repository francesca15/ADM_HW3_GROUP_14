$350	3	Clifton	June 2016	This waterfront lake house with spectacular views is in a quiet, secluded neighborhood about 1/2 mile from Uncle Gus' Marina on Lake Whitney, between towns of Whitney and Meridian on HWY 22. Our total property is more than an acre, with many trees, at the end of a road. The home is convenient for fishing, hiking, bicycling and water sports of all kinds--or settle into a comfortable lounge chair on the deck and read a book. Remodel is underway - will post interior photos soon.	31.8716014859306	-97.4259233225971	Updated Waterfront Home with Amazing Views	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13386265?location=Clifton%2C%20TX
