$59	1	Austin	January 2013	Hi, I'm Adam from Austin, Texas and I am excited to host you! I built the little house on the hill as a micro home; it has everything a home has in a very small package. I truly love this home and can’t wait to share it with you!  The Little House on the Hill has a beautiful country view and atmosphere just minutes from everything Austin has to offer.  The little house is a beautifully hand crafted 340 sq. ft. micro home built on top of a hill overlooking the south Austin skyline. The cottage can comfortably accommodate up to 2 adults. Inside there is a full kitchen, full-size loft bed, walk-in-shower, 40 inch flat screen TV with basic cable channels, sm. couch and small folding table and chair.   ********************PLEASE NOTE*********************** We DO NOT offer internet in the house, however we have fantastic LTE cell-phone service with most carriers (att, t-mobile, version, sprint) so that you can still enjoy internet through your smart phone. *****************************************************************  The kitchen has brand new stainless steel appliances, which include a microwave, gas oven and stove, refrigerator and reclaimed vintage cast iron sink set in a custom concrete counter top. Coffee maker, pots, pans, dishes and utensils are also included in the kitchen. There is also a pantry to store dry groceries. We do not have a dish washer so you will be responsible for washing your dishes before leaving. Caffeinated coffee, creamer and sweetener are also included for your enjoyment.   The bathroom is full size and includes a large walk in shower with overhead lighting. The restroom is NOT separated by a door, therefore, minimal privacy is available while using the restroom facilities. This is a one room cottage; you will not want to stay here with someone you are not comfortable with, there is NO door for the toilet. Very open concept. Hand towels, bath towels, washcloths, toilet paper and hand soap are included during your stay. Please bring your own toiletries.  Beside the bathroom and under the loft bed is a designated closet area which includes a cabinet for folded clothes, and a clothes rod for hanging garments. ABOVE the closet area is the full size bed, with a comfy foam mattress. Two alternative-down pillows and linens are provided. The bed is 7 feet in the air and therefore, a ladder is used to access the bed, gaurd rails are set on either side of the bed for your added safety. In addition, the clearance above the bed is only 3 feet so it's very cozy.  The living room is simple with a sm. Ikea couch (not meant for sleeping unfortunately), a flat screen TV with basic local cable along with a small folding desk and single chair area for any working needs.    A rear patio/deck with an amazing view of south Austin is included in your stay. A back patio for your enjoyment outdoors with dining table and chairs.   *********************PLEASE NOTE********************** If you are considering traveling with your pet, I apologize we are NO LONGER ALLOW PETS.  *****************************************************************  Smoking is NOT allowed inside the cabin, however you may step outside of the cabin onto the patio and enjoy lovely views and peaceful feelings are free.  I do work on the property in a workshop on the acreage with 2 other employees most days of the week, I own my own company. I'm also in the process of building a home for our family along with another micro home. I have a german sheperd, Heidi who often accompanies me on work days. Please do not be afraid of her though, she is extremely friendly, but does have a big bark :) I also have a fiancé Rachel, and son who are often on the property, we are building for our homesite. My fiancé also has 3 dogs, all of which are friendly and range in size but are all loving rescue pups. Rachel, my son and her 3 dogs are currently off site until final construction of our homesite on the property. We would love to host you at our beautiful slice of paradise in Austin!
