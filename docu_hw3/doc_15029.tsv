$45	1	Dallas	June 2012	You'll have access to the laundry room, patio and kitchen. Your room is eclectic and comfortable. There is a clay running track behind my house. My home is 8 miles north of downtown Dallas in a quiet neighborhood that feels a bit like suburbia but isn't. My neighborhood is diverse economically and racially. I've begun making updates to this house. The futon is a full/queen. The firm, packed mattress is comfortable to most. Direct sunlight afternoon only.	32.9030334223103	-96.7391075762007	Room of your own in artist's home.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/522576?location=Addison%2C%20TX
