$375	3	College Station	July 2016	It's all about location! Our house is in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to campus. Far enough away to retreat from the noise, but a short drive to Kyle Field to see all the action. (4 miles to Kyle Field)    Our home is the home to 3 dogs. They will NOT be here when you all are! Just a heads up in case any of you have allergies!
