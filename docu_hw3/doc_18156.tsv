$23	1	Humble	May 2017	My best friend is my co-host &amp; she runs it. Reasonably priced lower than a hotel night. This will be a 5 STAR experience for you. Sleep in late, checkout at noon. Clean &amp; comfy private room and restroom for a night in Houston. 20 minutes from IAH airport. Just seconds away from gas stations/restaurants/shopping strips/movie theater &amp; a bowling alley near by... plenty of options to choose from, very convenient!	29.936234124172696	-95.26261767968658	Home away from Home.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18997638?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
