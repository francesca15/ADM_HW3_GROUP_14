$36	1	Dallas	May 2015	DFW Airport and Love Field are 35 minutes and 25 minutes away, respectively. Private entry access to guest suite on 3rd level. There is a dedicated guest parking area that will be detailed upon booking. This is important because overnight you could be towed if parked in the wrong area.  You have full access to everything in the unit if you like. I will give you a gate access card with the door key upon check-in so you can feel comfortable coming and going with no restrictions.	32.907779050555504	-96.7175204436485	Comfortable, Clean and Private in North Dallas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19266651?location=Addison%2C%20TX
