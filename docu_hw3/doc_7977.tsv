$115	1	Carmine	June 2014	My place is very close to Round Top, Texas and Festival Hill. Youâ€™ll love the ambiance of a newly constructed classic farmhouse with modern conveniences like WIFI and Satellite TV and an espresso machine! Dark skies make star-gazing possible. Very close to many destinations on the Antique Fair route. Multiple rooms can be blocked for larger groups.	30.133822755371398	-96.7105025910584	Downstairs Guest Room in New Carmine Farmhouse	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14948223?location=Carmine%2C%20TX
