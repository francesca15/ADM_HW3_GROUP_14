$325	3	Mico	May 2016	Youâ€™ll love my place because of being on the lake, the views, outdoors space, the kitchen, and yet convenient (within 40 minutes of San Antonio shopping to the south &amp; hill country shopping to the north). The lake house gives you all the comforts of home.  The lake house is on the main body of deep water with incredible views of Medina Lake - approx. 90' of lake frontage. My place is good for couples, and families (with kids). Perfect year-round getaway.	29.5557294832337	-98.9606526233907	Medina Lake House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18255764?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
