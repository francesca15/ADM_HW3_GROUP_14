$35	1	Conroe	April 2017	We have a 3 bed, 2 bath home and it's just Chris and I. The guest room is on the opposite side of the house with the office next to you. You also have your own private bath. It's a very cozy, quiet home and neighborhood. We live 10/15 minutes from The Woodlands, 5 minutes from Lake Conroe and about 5 minutes from all things Conroe. 25 minutes from Huntsville.  I'm always a text or call away to answer any questions you might have and give you tips for things around here to do! :)	30.3230118862914	-95.5375046156664	Comfy Conroe Spot!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18226615?location=Conroe%2C%20TX
