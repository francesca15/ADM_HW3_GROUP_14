$70	1	San Antonio	June 2016	Our private guest bedroom has its own bathroom, private patio, and gorgeous views. Swim in the pool, float on a raft, listen to the waterfall, order pizza by the outdoor fire, or just relax on your own patio while the sun sets!  Can't beat the location! We are just minutes away from Sea World and Six Flags. And, downtown San Antonio and the airport are 20min from our door.   Your side key entrance to the house and back stairwell allows a more private way of accessing your space! It's bliss!	29.685034736433	-98.5065023025325	Mediterranean Zen Villa with a stellar pool!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13634105?location=Bulverde%2C%20TX
