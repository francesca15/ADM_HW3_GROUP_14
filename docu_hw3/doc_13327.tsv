$150	2	Athens	January 2017	My place is close to Athens and Canton Shopping. I grew up near Athens, TX and now live in the Woodlands. We use our home there when my children and I come back to visit our extended family. I have restored the property back into ‘like new’ condition but kept the history and memories of our family home. I am hopeful you enjoy our Heritage House as much as we do. With star filled nights, a constant breeze, fresh country air and sounds, you would struggle to find a more serene place to stay.	32.1145226490033	-95.7780299544644	Rest and Relax at Heritage House Ranch	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16659759?location=Athens%2C%20TX
