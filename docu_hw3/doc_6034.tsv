$39	1	La Porte	April 2016	My place is within walking distance to parks, public transport, and Galveston Bay. NASA Space Center Houston is 9 miles away, Kemah Boardwalk 5, historic San Jacinto battleground and monument 7, Sylvan Beach 3, and 25 minutes east of downtown Houston . Youâ€™ll love my place because of the kitchen, the coziness, and the views. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. As of June 2, we have completed refurbishing of our air conditioning for the comfort of our guests.	29.6185031967687	-95.0205279016814	Room by the Bay with private balcony	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13092788?location=Channelview%2C%20TX
