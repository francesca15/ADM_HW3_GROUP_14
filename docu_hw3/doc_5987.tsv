$37	1	Carrollton	January 2017	My place is 13.3 miles from DFW, 18.1 from Love Field and 20 miles from downtown Dallas. I am also close to I-35, I-635, 121 toll and George Bush toll (161).   My place is close to everything, family oriented, pet friendly and everyone is down to earth. The room that you will be staying in has a Jack and Jill bathroom, but no one will be sharing the bathroom with you.   My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	32.9974682291025	-96.9195779758297	Carrollton, TX Private Room and Private Bath	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17013389?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
