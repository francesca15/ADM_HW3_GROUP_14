$150	2	Kerrville	August 2014	The guest house has been our Familys guest house for 21 years. A much loved niche tucked into a tree filled yard. The history still lingers in the old wood floors. Nestled in the heart of town. Enjoy the Guadalupe River with a canoe ride, a slide down the Ingram Dam or take a dip for some swimming. Sleeps 4 comfortably.	30.063678189173004	-99.1516376328603	1940's Hill Country Style GUEST HOUSE	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3998129?location=Center%20Point%2C%20TX
