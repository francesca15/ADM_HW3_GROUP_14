$39	1	Frisco	January 2014	Me and a roommate live in this spacious 2,500 square feet single story house. The house is walking distance to Warren Sports Complex (sports park with multiple fields and a beautiful lake.) The house is also close to restaurants and dinning, and all of Frisco's new development. You will not be disappointed, the house has a private pool, an office space, and comfortable living areas. This place is great for business travelers, or any solo adventurers.	33.1712099120926	-96.80738462143309	Private room in spacious 3 bedroom house	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11591124?location=Celina%2C%20TX
