$23	1	Bandera	April 2015	Just the basics. A clean, comfortable and safe place to stay. We recently had some long-term renters leave and I'm trying to get it back in condition to it's enjoyable days. I will be out there occasionally, but I do not stay on the property. I'm always available for questions. If you see an improvement needed, let me know. It's a great place in a great part of Texas.	29.639378568150303	-98.98612972561449	AWOL Guest House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14024198?location=Center%20Point%2C%20TX
