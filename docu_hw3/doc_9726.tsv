$75	1	Frisco	January 2016	Jacuzzi jet tub and comfort vibes...  Olympian pool, gated community, BBQ grills (propaine), 24 hour gym, lake and park in backyard (able to fish but have to throw fish back in).  Usually I am out of town if I'm renting space but if I'm in town I'll check in maybe a couple times a day to make sure of the guest needs anything and if everything is going fine.  Really quiet and pet friendly.  Uber and lyft.	33.1608350651531	-96.8924157944002	Cool laid back apartment	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18471866?location=Celina%2C%20TX
