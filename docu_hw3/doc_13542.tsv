$70	1	Katy	May 2016	My place is close to La Centerra and Grand Parkway . Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location and the neighborhood.   Large house on a quite street on almost three acres of land. there is a pool in the backyard and Buffalo bayou come right up to our property. Walking and running trail right along the bayou.   Private bathroom with shower and tub.   My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.  We do have one dog, but he is quite and usually never enters that room.	29.7361892238216	-95.7953910488427	Quiet Bedroom along the bayou	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13577830?location=Beasley%2C%20TX
