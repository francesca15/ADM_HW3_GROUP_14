$105	2	Fulshear	December 2016	Our barn loft apartment is located on our 40 acre horse farm in beautiful Fulshear, Texas.  The farm is covered with century old pecan trees, and is a peaceful oasis from the city, without being too far away. It is close to highly rated restaurants (Doziers, Dekkers, Anthonie's, Essence House), and the popular Fulshear cycling routes.  It is a 25 minute drive via I-10 to the Houston Energy Corridor, and 35 min via the Westpark Tollway to downtown Houston.	29.6995964613545	-95.94543164991458	Treehouse Farm- Barn Loft Apartment	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16693845?location=Beasley%2C%20TX
