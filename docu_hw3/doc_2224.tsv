$275	2	Eustace	August 2016	Our Lake House is the hub of family-friendly activities. Great swimming &amp; fishing right off the dock. Our cabin is cozy with all the amenities (volleyball, grill &amp; hammock!), and good for couples, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets). Covered porch is awesome.	32.303797394705896	-96.10465285966178	Cozy Cedar Creek Lake House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14315306?location=Corsicana%2C%20TX
