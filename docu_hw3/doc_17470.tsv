$40	1	Dallas	June 2014	This is a great central location if you want to enjoy the city without the traffic and chaos, or need a temporary living situation for a new job! We are clean, friendly, and laid back- but at the same time have some rules to make sure you stay comfortable! Small pets are welcome (we have two outside dogs) and the pool/jacuzzi, kitchen, and living area are all available for guests to use!	33.0111249255168	-96.8074259753733	Cozy central location-pool/Jacuzzi	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15479098?location=Allen%2C%20TX
