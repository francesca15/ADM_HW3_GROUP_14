$500	4	Flower Mound	September 2016	My place is close to family-friendly activities, the airport, and nightlife. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the high ceilings and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.  Sidewalks, walking paths, close to walk to a Starbucks and neighborhood equestrian center. Enjoy a 5 mile run/walk to Lake Grapevine and the public hiking/biking trails or marina and music.	33.0516061034523	-97.1021819062513	Quiet cul-de-sac 12mi to DFW	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15537034?location=Argyle%2C%20TX
