$175	3	Bastrop	January 2013	My house was built in late 2011 and I enjoy that, other than being furnished, it almost looks like new still to this day. There is very little wear and tear. My sister enjoys drinking on the back porch in the mornings and watching the wildlife come in close.	30.0930814134446	-97.30591095442709	Austin Days/Country Nights	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/956352?location=Bastrop%2C%20TX
