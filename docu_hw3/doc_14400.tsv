$35	1	Manor	August 2015	My brand new, cute little house is located just off of 290 in Manor, TX about 12 miles from Austin! It is peaceful out here but not far from town. There is a Walmart just a few blocks away and they are building out here constantly. I built here just under a year ago and since then we have gotten a Starbucks, Taco Bell, Shipley's Doughnuts, What-a-burger as well as many other shops and gas stations! There is a 24 hour gym for $20 a month located less than a mile away.	30.3555640127309	-97.5229132433906	Country Casa	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14498534?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
