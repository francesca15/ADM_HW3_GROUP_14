$144	2	The Woodlands	June 2014	My place is close to the airport, walking distance to the major concerts at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, restaurants, shops, and parks. Youâ€™ll love my place because we're 2 blocks from the Town Center of the Woodlands and 3 blocks from the Woodlands Mall. You will find this location special because of the ambiance, the people, and the outdoors space. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	30.157130451016503	-95.4592744007014	Charming Apartment in The Woodlands Town Center	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15116748?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
