$60	Studio	Corpus Christi	October 2015	My place is close to Schliterbahn, the canal, and five minutes from the beach. There are souvenir shops and restaurants on the same block. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, quirky sixties style building, and close proximity to island entertainment. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.	27.6230946389503	-97.2218651928266	Island Studio	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13860501?location=Corpus%20Christi%2C%20TX
