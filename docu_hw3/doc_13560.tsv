$65	1	Houston	June 2014	This is a great carriage house that we just totally gutted and put up this year! Custom kitchen cabinets, granite tops, marble shower, and wood floors. We let a friend stay here for a while but now we are renting it for Super Bowl at the last minute. WALK ANYWHERE OR TAKE THE METRO. Great location in the heart of Midtown. It is a studio/loft with one bathroom. Perfect for taking on the SuperBowl. Walk to downtown, bars, restaurants, metro...	29.7443990332313	-95.37938988264179	Carriage house in MIDTOWN!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17023072?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
