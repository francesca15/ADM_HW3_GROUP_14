$100	Studio	Liberty Hill	February 2017	Our visiting family and friends always love staying in the cabin. It offers privacy in a peaceful and relaxing setting. Enjoy morning coffee or a glass of wine on the covered porch where you may see deer, wildlife and birds of all kinds. We are also minutes away from the train into Austin, a winery, a brew pub, and Liberty Hill. This is a great spot to come back to after seeing the beautiful Hill Country or heading into Austin or Georgetown for the day. Everyone is welcome here!	30.695048390072998	-97.8708314392775	Delightful cabin in the woods	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17444969?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
