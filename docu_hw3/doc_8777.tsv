$65	1	Cedar Park	July 2015	The Burgundy room is cozy and has a queen sized bed suitable for two persons. The bathroom has a shower/tub. Get a good nights sleep and enjoy a big country breakfast in the morning before exploring nearby Austin. FYI, If more space is needed, I have another room which can accommodate 3 persons and another area which works well for one person. Each space needs to be reserved separately. The entire loft area can accommodate 6 persons comfortably. Thank you for choosing my B and B.	30.529413090679697	-97.8255778033725	Burgundy Room Bed and Breakfast near Austin, TX	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8411669?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
