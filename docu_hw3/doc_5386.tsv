$37	3	Austin	March 2017	Pretty basic house in a quiet neighborhood in NW Austin, ~14 miles from downtown, 7 miles from The Domain, and 10 miles from Lake Travis. 4 beds (3 for guests, 1 for me), 2 1/2 baths, with a big covered patio. All rooms have queen beds, plus I have an extra twin bed I can set up too. All rooms are upstairs. Take as many rooms as you need, I'm not splitting it into multiple bookings. I live here solo with my 2 dogs - feel free to bring your dogs too if they're friendly and housebroken!	30.4605754602217	-97.77251977643299	4 bed house in NW Austin.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17702190?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
