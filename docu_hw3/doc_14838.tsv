$85	1	Houston	October 2016	Located amid the live oaks of revitalized Midtown, bounded by Downtown Houston, Montrose, and the Museum District. Location, Location, Location! Very walkable! My place is close to Downtown, Montrose, Medical Center, Museum District, the best cafes and shops, and the light rail. It is only 5 miles from the galleria area. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the 10' high ceilings, the location, and the views. It is great for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.
