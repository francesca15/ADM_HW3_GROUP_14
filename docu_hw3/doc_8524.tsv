$98	3	San Antonio	July 2016	My place is a 10 minute drive to SeaWorld, 25 minutes to Six Flags, and a quick 20 minute drive to downtown! Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness. It's in a quiet neighborhood with a community pool and if you like stargazing you'll see plenty here at night. Perfect for a family on vacation. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	29.3957748508919	-98.71106861278672	Comfy Cozy Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13980825?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
