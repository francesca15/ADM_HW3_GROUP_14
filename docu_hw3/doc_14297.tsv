$50	1	Austin	January 2014	Come stay with us in our cozy house. The house is well located for visiting Austin and is a great place to retreat to after a long day of fun or work. It's a 15 min walk to the light rail station which will take you one stop to the hip East 6th St District or two stops to Downtown. There are many neighborhood coffee shops, bars, and restaurants within walking distance as well. Fitz, our small and friendly dog, would look forward to cuddling with you at the end or beginning of your day.	30.2800995952783	-97.7140573803113	Walkable, Comfortable, Cozy East Side room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18039507?location=Austin%2C%20TX
