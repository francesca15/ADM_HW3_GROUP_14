$34	1	Dallas	August 2012	Welcome to my humble little duplex! It's just minutes from the Bishop Arts District, where you'll find great restaurants, coffee shops, and local stores. I have boardgames and books you can use too! Easy access to the highways and multiple short routes to downtown. The bed is a comfy queen size memory foam mattress and there are three huge pecan trees in the backyard. There is also a deck for hanging out. I'm continually doing home improvement projects and will update the photos as I go.
