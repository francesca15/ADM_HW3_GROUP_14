$32	1	Plano	February 2016	My place is close to public transportation and family-friendly activities. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. There are many restaurants and shops nearby. Walmart is wihtin 0.3 miles and Shops at Legacy is 10 mins away driving, a nice place to know.	33.053459644130996	-96.7648310432366	Private Room w/ Queen size bed and Bathroom	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15974050?location=Celina%2C%20TX
