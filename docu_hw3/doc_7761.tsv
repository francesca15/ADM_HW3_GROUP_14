This lovely home sits on a large piece of land, perfect for getting away from it all with your friends and family.  Imagine your drive away from town into the beautiful hilly cabins surrounding Canyon Lake. The stress melts away. Casa del Lago greets you with sweeping lake vistas, ample yard space, lakefront swimming and fishing, and comfortable accomodations for your Canyon Lake getaway. Ahhh..  Casa del Lago is a tremendous lakefront value. Lakefront properties on the clear blue waters of Canyon Lake are few and far between. Spend your getaway sipping a beverage on the breezy porch, playing ping pong, grilling with a view, resting under the shady oaks, fishing from the shore, or splashing and swimming in the refreshing lake waters. Bring your float, your floaties, your favorite lounge chair, and your cowboy hat and have a relaxing and lazy day without ever leaving the house. Sitting on a half acre, Casa del Lago is a perfect place for letting the kids play outside and take in the Great Outdoors.
