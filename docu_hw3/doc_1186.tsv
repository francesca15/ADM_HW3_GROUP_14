$60	1	Grapevine	June 2016	Our home is close to the airport, with large shopping centers a mile away. Youâ€™ll love visiting us because of the location, the kitchen, the high ceilings, the comfortable beds, and the pool. (There are actually 2 separate bedrooms available with their own bath - but I can't get this software to show more than 1 bedroom. The second bedroom is available for an additional charge of $40/day, payable on arrival). My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	32.8871767247148	-97.09082314959558	House with pool close to DFW airport	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13390076?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
