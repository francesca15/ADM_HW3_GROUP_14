$75	1	Alpine	August 2016	Alpine Creek Cottage was originally built in the 1920's with a small room added in the 1940's. It is a quaint little cottage tucked right up against Alpine Creek. Alpine Creek runs through Alpine and serves as a thoroughfare for wildlife, including deer, javelin and fox. All of which we have spotted on many occasions. So an appreciation for wildlife is a good thing if you are considering booking this room.	30.3620995226625	-103.662270571141	Alpine Creek Cottage Room 1	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14705155?location=Alpine%2C%20TX
