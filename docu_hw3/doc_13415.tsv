$52	1	Austin	March 2015	I love my home because it is in a quiet small neighborhood (just 5 miles south of downtown) but still very close to the festivities this city has to offer. Guests will have access to the kitchen, upstairs bedroom, and private bathroom. My bedroom is downstairs so guests will pretty much have the upstairs to themselves, so it is quite private. I love to interact and socialize with guests but I also respect privacy.	30.2123326696037	-97.7885155366143	Modern Home 5 miles South of DT	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12107296?location=Austin%2C%20TX
