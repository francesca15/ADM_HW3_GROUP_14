$250	3	Bastrop	August 2015	We built our retirement home in Bastrop, Texas and until that time are offering it out as vacation rental. It has all the modern amenities with plenty of open spaces. NON SMOKING PROPERTY. PLEASE BE ADVISED WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT PETS. Also be advised for stays longer than 2 weeks an additional cleaning fee will be added for cleaning service to come in and clean during your stay. Because of past experience with a traveler we feel that this additional fee is warranted.	30.095297663846804	-97.28651038739879	Bastrop Beauty near Austin events	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7954036?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
