$40	1	Austin	December 2016	Our place is close to The Mueller Community 12-minute ride to Downtown Austin 12-minute ride to the center of the University of Texas campus.  Youâ€™ll love our place because our back yard is part of the local greenbelt (450sf deck overlooking Little Walnut Creek), and the comfort and coziness. Quiet neighborhood; ideal for a good night's sleep. There is no television in the bedroom, but most guests use their laptops and free wi-fi to watch what they want.	30.3194151983777	-97.6768044592305	Creek Zen	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16297180?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
