$265	2	South Padre Island	February 2017	Wake up to a beautiful sunrise with birds chirping in this tropical paradise.

Friendly atmosphere, walking distance to restaurants, shopping centers, grocery stores and night clubs. Great for families. There is a coin operated laundromat onsite. BBQ grilling is allowed away from the building. Entertainment is just steps away, this place is sure to make vacation memorable.	26.101983464115502	-97.1632964590733	LP 207 2bd 2bath sleeps 6 Oceanfront condo	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17875946?location=Brownsville%2C%20TX
