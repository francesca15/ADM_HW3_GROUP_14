$249	2	Burton	January 2017	Sit back and relax at our 1880's farm house that is completely remodeled with all the modern amenities. Set back from the road on the top of a hill, so you can enjoy the porch swing and rockers in peace and quiet, with the only other sounds being birds chirping, chickens pecking and the sound of the breeze blowing. Secluded, yet only 5 miles from Round Top Square and 18 miles from Brenham.  2 beds, 2.5 baths, full kitchen, living area, dining and laundry room. Owners live on property.	30.1087335157106	-96.60368372885901	Blue Hill Farm House, 5 miles from Round Top	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16996499?location=Chappell%20Hill%2C%20TX
