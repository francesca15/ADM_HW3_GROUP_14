$89	2	Haslet	January 2017	Our guest house (barndominium) was recently built out with high-end finishes (granite, hardwoods, etc) and nice furniture. Overlooking a pool (feel free to use) and with a nice patio and grill, you will feel right at home.  With large lots and friendly neighbors, the neighborhood is great for getting out and walking/running and spending time outdoors.	32.9830691718447	-97.3997821196519	New, Cozy, Barndominium With Pool and Yard	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16633328?location=Azle%2C%20TX
