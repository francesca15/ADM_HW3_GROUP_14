$35	1	Dallas	December 2012	My home is in a safe, quiet neighborhood close to Love Field Airport, the Great State Fair of Texas, parks, art and culture, downtown and the Deep Ellum and Arts District areas, and has great access to all major highways. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the ambiance, the light, the outdoors space, and the comfy bed(s). My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	32.8554134211284	-96.7049377455647	Dallas Home By the Lake, Arboretum, Downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15420172?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
