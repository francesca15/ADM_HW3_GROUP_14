$150	2	Grapevine	August 2012	NEW LISTING! Best location as it is 1 1/2 blocks from the center of Main St. Lots of restaurants, shopping, and activities. We love this area for day and/or night time events. Farmers' market available outside seasonally and a local market for fresh items year round on Main St. Excellent local crafts and goodies at market. Too many good things to name. It is a very safe neighborhood for walking with lots of friendly folks. Enjoy walking trails, Lake Grapevine, and our quaint movie theatre.	32.937419524359605	-97.0755333211682	Pepper A	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19457387?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
