$75	1	New Braunfels	July 2016	I have a comfortable private room on the opposite side of the house with a private bathroom. My place is secluded in a gated community in hill country but only minutes from several attractions such as tubing, wineries and vineyards, Gruene, Schlitterbahn, downtown New Braunfels, Canyon Lake, and Natural Bridge Caverns. Guests have access to the whole home which includes indoor and outdoor fireplaces and a fire pit. I have great views and at night you can see more stars than you could imagine.	29.793178059717498	-98.2483987799015	Quiet back bedroom in gated Hill Country home.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14246334?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
