$37	1	Irving	November 2015	My place is close to the airport, public transport, and the city center. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the comfy bed, the coziness, the kitchen, and the light. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). I am an experienced airbnb host. I enjoy meeting people from all walks of life and would be happy to make you as comfortable as possible. #FromHome	32.8602811040161	-96.99707983573309	Home Away From Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15537000?location=Colleyville%2C%20TX
