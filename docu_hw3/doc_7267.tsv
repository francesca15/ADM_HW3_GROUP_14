$75	1	Houston	July 2014	My apartment is in the perfect location for those wanting to explore Houston. Within walking distance are great restaurants, bars, coffee shops, museums, and vintage/antique shopping. The living room and bedroom are filled with ample natural light from expansive windows. There is plenty of street parking if you're bringing a car but you can also get by fine with just your feet!	29.739768067614	-95.40294245839621	Bright One-Bedroom in the Heart of Montrose	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17620083?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
