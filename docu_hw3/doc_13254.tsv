$37	1	Dallas	September 2015	My place is close to restaurants and dining, public transport, family-friendly activities, and everything that Dallas has to offer. White Rock Lake within a mile, so is the Clyde Warren Park, or the arts/museums, or the Fair park, just to name a few. You’ll love my place because of the location, my clean, cozy, modest home. If you don't mind cleaning up after yourself and taking your shoes off to enter my castle, than you want to stay with me. Sie können mich auch in Deutsch anschreiben :).	32.7843649348264	-96.7215858538598	"clean, cozy, comfy room for 2 close downtown ""D"""	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8269221?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
