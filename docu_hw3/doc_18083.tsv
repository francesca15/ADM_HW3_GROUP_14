$85	1	Alpine	December 2012	This guest cottage was once an art studio. It is very comfortable, cozy, quiet, and private. It is located on a 40 acre ranch with wonderful views, horses and abundant wildlife. I live on this ranch along with a long term renters residing in separate houses. The guest cottage is near houses but we are all very quiet and respectful of privacy. I am building trails on the property and I encourage my guests to get outside a take a stroll.	30.344798413872798	-103.676451846782	Pi√±on Ranch Guest Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/852958?location=Alpine%2C%20TX
