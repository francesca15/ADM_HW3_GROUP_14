$49	2	Brownsville	May 2015	Youâ€™ll love my place because of the 24 hour gated security with an attendant. We are in a resort with three heated pools, a large hot tub, tennis courts, shuffleboard courts, pool tables, and a golf chipping range. It is 23 miles to the beach at South Padre Island, and Mexico is nearby. Three golf courses are in Brownsville.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	25.9569792366465	-97.46067208555358	Casa de Winterhaven	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6526959?location=Brownsville%2C%20TX
