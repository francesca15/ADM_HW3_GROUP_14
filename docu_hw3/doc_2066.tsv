$37	1	Beaumont	January 2017	My home is on a cul-de-sac in a quiet Beaumont neighborhood that's about 17 min from downtown. There is plenty of driveway parking for an extra car. The ground floor of the home is spacious, and I have a large kitchen that is well equipped with all cutlery and dishes guests will need to make a meal. Upstairs there are two guest rooms and a private bathroom. Guests will have the entire upstairs to themselves and it is very quiet there at night. My wifi in the house is fast and runs at 35 Mbps.	30.0845491943235	-94.1737591517859	Private bedroom and private upstairs in huge house	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17748592?location=Beaumont%2C%20TX
