$70	Studio	Bastrop	June 2016	The Loft is an apartment above the detached garage located here at Ranch di Serenita. It is a piece of Texas heaven to come and relax in serenity. You can wake up to watch the deer come into the yard or go give the horses some lovin' as the bunnies scamper by you. If you prefer, you can sit on the upper deck with your morning coffee and listen to a variety of birds singing and watch the hummingbirds up close. At night a bonfire and cicadas singing. It's all waiting for you here at the ranch.	30.116442192563	-97.403342640055	Ranch di Serenita	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18459353?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
