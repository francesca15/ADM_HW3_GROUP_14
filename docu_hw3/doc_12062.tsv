$110	Studio	Port Isabel	June 2017	Our family purchased the historical Alta Vista, which was built in 1931, in 2003 and began a complete authentic restoration while preserving some of its original features, including the beautiful oak flooring, exterior masonry and doors. We have modernized with central air conditioning, on-demand hot water, satellite TV, WI-FI internet and swimming pool. The kitchens and bathrooms feature beautiful talavera tile and saltillo tile floors which we brought with us from trips to Central Mexico.	26.078298066594897	-97.21439157184271	Historical Alta Vista - Saltillo Unit #3	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19415246?location=Brownsville%2C%20TX
