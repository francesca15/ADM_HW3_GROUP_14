$40	1	Irving	October 2016	Close to restaurants, dining, shopping, DFW airport, large corporations, bus stop, and DART. No need for a car. If I am available, I am more than happy to drive you wherever you need in exchange for a gratuity and any tolls incurred. If I'm not available, everything is a close Uber ride away. Perfect for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).	32.8675443559359	-96.98030273227741	Close to DFW	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15661191?location=Carrollton%2C%20TX
