$20	1	San Antonio	October 2013	The Den is an OPEN space for overflow when the rooms are full or for guests who need a more economical option. It is private in the sense it is not shared. AirBnB has only 2 choices. Great for overnight crashing and the mattress is surprisingly comfortable. Some guests may prefer the love-seat or their own cot etc and that's fine too. No charge for 1 additional guest as long as you have a plan for sleeping arrangements. Smoking is allowed outside. No 420 or illegal drugs! No furry pets.	29.399046225893102	-98.66143334156371	Air Mattress / Love Seat in Den overflow crashpad	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16388953?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
