$75	1	Houston	September 2013	My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. We are located within walking distance of Space Center Houston, 5 miles from the Kemah Boardwalk, 4.5 miles from Baybrook Mall, and about 23 miles from the Galveston Seawall. There are many restaurants within walking distance as well. Our neighborhood is very safe and inviting. There are two nice parks in our neighborhood, both of which have bay views. There is also a marina for boat launching.	29.546329215073104	-95.0945929575355	Guesthouse Getaway	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14932246?location=Clear%20Lake%20Shores%2C%20TX
