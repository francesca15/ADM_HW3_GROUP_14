$70	1	Coppell	August 2016	Our place is close to DFW Airport, Arlington (Texas Rangers, Dallas Cowboys, &amp; Six Flags!!). Coppell is a suburb of Dallas and named the #8 best place to live according to Time. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the trendy, farmhouse, feel it has. We have a Crossfit style gym in the garage! If Crossfit's not your thing, there are several gyms nearby. Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	32.968352334615	-97.00771026060129	Adorable Texas Home: 1 bed, 1 bath, 3mi from DFW	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15919041?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
