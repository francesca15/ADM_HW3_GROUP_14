$140	2	Little Elm	June 2015	My place is spacious and has a view of the lake from every room. Youâ€™ll love the outdoors space, the unique architecture, and the relaxing, quiet atmosphere. It's perfect for all. We have sleeping spaces for 5. Also a very large living room to accommodate air mattresses, etc. Only $10/person beyond 5.  I do require that bookings are made by persons age 25 or over. The beach at Little Elm Park is absolutely the best in the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex, and is only 5 minutes away from my house.	33.1990668856401	-96.96005391585791	Peaceful Lakefront Retreat	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13751175?location=Corinth%2C%20TX
