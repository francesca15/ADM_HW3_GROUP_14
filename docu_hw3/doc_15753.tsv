$4000	5	El Campo	September 2016	My place is close to restaurants and dining and the city center. Youâ€™ll love my place because you get the privacy of a get away vacation but you're also not far from town. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	29.2201558337215	-96.257765469972	Paradise on the Prairie	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14935668?location=Bay%20City%2C%20TX
