$43	1	Austin	February 2014	South Austin, close to downtown. Walk to coffee, restaurants, and shopping. This house is old and ready for a remodel, but we keep it clean and it's a very safe, family-friendly neighborhood, while still close to much of Austin's fun.  This is a single, private room with both a queen bed and a twin-sized daybed.	30.2474313996375	-97.77883534993641	Quiet family neighborhood, a block off South Lamar	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17408557?location=Austin%2C%20TX
