$70	1	Austin	June 2012	Cute apartment in Austin's growing Eastside. One bed and one couch, so it accommodates three people comfortably. But if you're willing to BYOBlow-up mattress, etc. then you can definitely fit more than three! Just let me know :)  Very close to downtown- about a 10 min. drive to 6th street!	30.220832813260397	-97.7267753940041	Cheerful East Austin Apartment Space	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18241162?location=Austin%2C%20TX
