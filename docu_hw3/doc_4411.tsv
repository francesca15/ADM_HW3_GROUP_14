$40	1	Austin	September 2016	Youâ€™ll love my place; clean, nicely decorated, quiet neighborhood. I am close to the Austin Airport, the COTA F1 Race Track, and an easy drive to the Downtown Austin Music Scene. My place is good for couples.	30.229681137125898	-97.58960716571609	Lannie's Place Bedroom #2	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16609141?location=Cedar%20Creek%2C%20TX
