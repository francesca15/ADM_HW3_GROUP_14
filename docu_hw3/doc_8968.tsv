$42	1	Dallas	November 2015	The neighborhood of Elmwood is rich in history, located in trendy North Oak Cliff. Oak Cliff is home to the Bishop Arts District, close to downtown (tourist central), and an inexpensive Uber ride to Cedar Springs. The historic Belmont Hotel is less than 10 minutes away, best brunch spots are 7 minutes door to door. Oak Cliff was the home of the notorious Bonnie and Clyde. Recuperate here for whatever adventure you find. 30 min from the Fort Worth Stockyards (real cowboy business) and about 20 min to Six Flags over Texas.	32.7268583565845	-96.8547705348408	Charming spot near the Bishop Arts	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17745217?location=Cedar%20Hill%2C%20TX
