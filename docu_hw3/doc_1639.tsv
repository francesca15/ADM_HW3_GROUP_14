$35	1	Dallas	December 2012	My home is close to Love Field airport, SMU, Fair Park and the downtown Arts and Design center. I'm just a mile from the beautiful Arboretum. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the safe neighborhood, the outdoor space, the light, the ambiance, and the comfy bed(s.) My home is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and college students.  IF you are an SMU fan or future student, it's right down the road... and Fair Park and the State Fair of Texas is just a few streets away!	32.855205621764895	-96.70482289179091	Dallas By The Lake - CLOSE to SMU & Cotton Bowl	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/860248?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
