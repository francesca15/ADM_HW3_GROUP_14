$37	1	Corpus Christi	May 2016	Get to any part of town quickly! My place is in the center of the city &amp; right next to the freeway. Youâ€™ll love my home because of the location/cleanliness! My roommate Tyler and I both occupy the house but we are respectful, nonintrusive, &amp; quiet.   The guest room is cozy, featuring a full size bed, a side drawer, and closet . The bathroom is shared. While I have my own private bathroom, Tyler utilizes the guest Airbnb bathroom and is flexible with sharing time. Hope you enjoy your stay here!	27.727108884531198	-97.40292779568121	Full Size Bed in a Cozy Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13251310?location=Aransas%20Pass%2C%20TX
