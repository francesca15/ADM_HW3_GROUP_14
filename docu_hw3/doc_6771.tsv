$45	1	Benbrook	November 2015	My place is close to great views along the Trinity River Trail, restaurants and shopping in Waterside and nightlife on West 7th Street. Family friendly activities abound in Fort Worth! Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location right off of I-20 and the Chisolm Trail Parkway for easy commuting and the Trinity Trail where I ride my bike downtown to work. My place is furnished and good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	32.6954183460148	-97.4183118435187	Townhome on the Trinity River	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16927341?location=Cleburne%2C%20TX
