$69	2	Houston	April 2015	My home is in the up and coming Near North side of Houston, which is 5min drive to downtown and close to all major freeways. It is also about a 7 minute walk to the light rail which will take you to downtown, NRG stadium, the museum district or the medical center. Our colorful community is a brand new development full of contemporary homes. The open concept in my house will comfortably fit up to 4 guests. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	29.7992743820961	-95.3579742608287	Contemporary Home Near Downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16771039?location=Baytown%2C%20TX
