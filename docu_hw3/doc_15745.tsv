$24	1	Dallas	September 2015	The bedroom has plenty of space, a large closet, windows that let natural light in, a personal ac unit to keep comfortable, a queen bed, and a light, fresh color on the walls. There is a side door which is the quickest way to get to the room and you will have a key for it of course so you can come and go as you please without coming through the front door and all through the house. The neighborhood is quiet, and full of trees, it's quite a beautiful sight.
