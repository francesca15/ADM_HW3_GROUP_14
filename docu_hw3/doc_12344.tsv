$1200	5	Austin	October 2012	We have a great home just South of the Lake, a stone’s throw away from downtown Austin. Importantly, we are a close and direct shot downtown. And, as a bonus, we are surrounded by the beauty of the famous Texas Hill Country!   You will indulge in a 3,600 square foot house with a great kitchen (gas stove), two downstairs living areas, and a huge upstairs gameroom with a pool table, plasma TV, and game table. There are 4 bedrooms upstairs with 2 full bathrooms. The bedrooms upstairs have two full beds and two queen beds. The large master bedroom is situated downstairs, and has a nice private sitting area and a king size bed. The master bathroom has a rain shower and a Jacuzzi tub. There is a powder room downstairs in the main hallway.   After a day of exploring the area, you can celebrate with a Texas BBQ in the spacious, furnished backyard; and relax.    If you don’t feel like cooking, no worries – there are great restaurants nearby. Or, you could simultaneously have dinner and catch a movie at the one-of-a-kind South Austin Alamo Draft House - newly opened in our neighborhood.   We are located off a major highway system that links directly to the Airport, Downtown SXSW Hotspots, Formula One Center, Zilker Park, and Sixth Street!!        Coffee maker, espresso machine, refrigerator, dish washer, clothes washer and dryer, WIFI, pots, pans, dishes, bedding, etc.   We have a very nice park with a disc golf course, biking and jogging trails.	30.187544490773202	-97.88884152806308	Sth.
