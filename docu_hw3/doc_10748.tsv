$68	2	Fort Worth	February 2017	Welcome to our original 1920's home. We recently purchased this 1922 home just a mile outside of downtown Fort Worth and have been happy restoring the original character that the home was built with. You're just a 5 minute drive from all that downtown has to offer and just across the street from the currently being rejuvenated Gateway Park.	32.7470973543511	-97.2864343970125	The Porch	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17325114?location=Burleson%2C%20TX
