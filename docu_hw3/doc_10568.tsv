$199	2	South Padre Island	August 2015	Beautiful 8th Floor 2B, 2B condo at Saida IV. The most popular complex on the Island. 3 swimming pools, 2 hot tubs, 4 tennis courts, and shuffleboard. The condo is beach front with great views. It is walking distance to shops and restaurants, and Saida has a pool-side snack cabana, and a separate bar cabana too.
