$115	2	Terlingua	October 2015	You are going to love spending time here. We are 3 miles from the Terlingua Ranch Headquarters and its a gorgeous 45 minute drive to Big Bend National Park. Youâ€™ll love being off the grid and being out in the wide open space in peace and quiet. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, authors, photographers, artists, business travelers, families, big groups, and pets. If you want to see what off-grid living (in style) is all about, come for a visit!	29.4296161608778	-103.411012527482	Casa Yurtopia!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14975927?location=Big%20Bend%20National%20Park%2C%20TX
