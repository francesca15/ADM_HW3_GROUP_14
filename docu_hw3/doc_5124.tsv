$100	Studio	Austin	August 2016	The Airstream is settled in a beautiful, wooded lot in South Austin. The ambiance, the landscape, the neighborhood, the light, and the people make this place special. You're 1.5 miles from Whole Foods, Kerbey Lane Cafe, Chuy's Tex-Mex, Costco, and many other amenities, all of which are accessible by walking trails.
