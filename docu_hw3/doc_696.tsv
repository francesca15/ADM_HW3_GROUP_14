$40	1	Austin	October 2016	My place is close to The Domain &amp; The Arboretum, 15m from Round Rock, 20m from the heart of Austin, the famous Kerby Lane, Torchies Tacos, and great views. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the beautiful sunrise every morning. You'll enjoy the view, the comfy bed, the at-home feeling, huge kitchen, great lighting, high ceilings, tall windows, and it's artistic style! My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), small groups, and furry friends (pets).	30.4614450074451	-97.7558922726234	8100 Elephant Place	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17462117?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
