$180	1	Willis	September 2015	My place is good for couples, business travelers, and families (with kids). The balcony hangs right over the water. The condo is a very peaceful setting. The condo faces east, and you can see a lovely sunrise. You can fish right from the balcony and even feed the ducks.	30.400318277306102	-95.5687781175786	Beautiful Lake Views- One Bedroom- Unit 141	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17603020?location=Conroe%2C%20TX
