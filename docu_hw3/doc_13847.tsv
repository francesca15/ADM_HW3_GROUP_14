$110	1	Galveston	January 2017	Your private suite is in my personal residence. I live here. It takes 2 minutes to walk to the Convention Center and the beach is a three minute walk away. A theme park (The Pleasure Pier) is two miles away on the Galveston Seawall. Moody Gardens is about four miles away. A Kroger grocery store (with a Starbucks Coffee Shop) is a three minute walk from the house. Gibbs House is excellent for couples, business travelers, small families, and solo adventurers.	29.2703305630517	-94.8238136581923	Gibbs House / Walk to the Beach	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16982846?location=Bayou%20Vista%2C%20TX
