$450	3	Bryan	August 2016	My place is 5 miles from Texas A&amp;M Kyle Field. This is my parents home where we've gathered for years. It provides a great home base for games and special events. It has been recently updated and has everything you need. There are 2 living areas, a kitchen with a table that can seat 6-10 people, and a quaint outdoor dining area. The bedrooms are clutter free and dressed in nice linens and bedding. Sleeps 12.	30.6578048407021	-96.36053060897422	Home Away From Home near Texas A&M Kyle Field	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14836105?location=College%20Station%2C%20TX
