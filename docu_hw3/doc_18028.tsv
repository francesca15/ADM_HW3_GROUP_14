$79	1	Austin	February 2013	Hi, well let's see- we've got a sweeeeet house, lots of indoor and outdoor spaces to be (a back deck off your room, and a front yard living room too). We are close to... EVERYthing! I think so, since I only leave my hood occasionally and then it's often on my bike. Great live music, fabulous food,  and of course the Springs and the Greenbelt all super close.	30.260409098706003	-97.7620802705101	Barton Springs room- coolest house!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14726558?location=Austin%2C%20TX
