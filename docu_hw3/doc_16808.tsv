$225	2	Trophy Club	May 2013	This is for a whole house rental with use of pool, laundry, study and garage if needed. This time of year it is so cosy and the fireplace creates a wonderful ambiance. I spend around half my time in London so am open to long-term share discussion. My home is very close to Texas Motor Speedway, Southlake Town Square, Grapevine Historic District, Gaylord Convention Center, Sabre, 15 minutes from DFW and close to both Dallas and Fort Worth. Unique, beautiful home that will wrap its arms around you.	32.9892319643491	-97.17534265582279	Little slice of England in Dallas..	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1160110?location=Argyle%2C%20TX
