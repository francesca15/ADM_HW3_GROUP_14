$40	1	Austin	January 2012	My place is close to the famous Jester King Brewery and The Salt Lick BBQ. We sit at the gateway to hill country vineyards and weekend getaways. About 30 minutes from downtown Austin in light traffic. Our friends love our high ceilings, huge kitchen and looking out at the deer, hawks and occasional jack rabbit. We have one indoor cat, Felix, who is well mannered. My place is good for solo adventurers and business travelers or just a couple of friends here to enjoy the hill country.	30.2137165796793	-97.9883462541449	}{Cheery Hill Country Mango Room}{	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17237634?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
