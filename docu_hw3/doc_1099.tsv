$80	Studio	Houston	October 2014	The apartment is located in the heart of Montrose which is a highly sought after neighborhood to visit in Houston. The area is very diverse and located within walking distance to many popular bars and restaurants. It is also 1 mile from downtown and close to public transportation. There is a loft bed and also a very comfortable fold down sofa. Keep in mind when booking that the loft bed requires navigating steps that are steep so you may want to sleep downstairs on the sofa bed.
