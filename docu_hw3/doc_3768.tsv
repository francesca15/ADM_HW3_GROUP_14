$100	2	Fort Worth	September 2014	Hi! I am excited to host you! My 1920's bungalow is my pride and joy. It is a 3 bedroom 2 bath home, but my personal room will be unaccessible. I have a large front yard that includes 2 porches to sit and drink coffee and a small backyard, that includes patio furniture and cafe lighting. You will be 15 min away from TCU, downtown Fort Worth, Cowboys stadium, and 30 min away from Dallas! Its a great location and easy to get to places from. Hope you enjoy!	32.7449681489336	-97.2480653978647	The Happy Eclectic Bungalow	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18315272?location=Colleyville%2C%20TX
