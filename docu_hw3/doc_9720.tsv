$99	2	fort worth	June 2014	Texas Vista Grata is a Southern Charmer. Entire home is all yours. Amazing Unobstructed Views from the Front Deck &amp; Private backyard. Home is cozy and very relaxing. Although located in a blue collar neighborhood, once you arrive to the hilltop where the Quaint home is located, you will see it is well worth it. I hope you will choose to stay.	32.7849095832658	-97.3945125324038	TEXAS VISTA GRATA Breathtaking Views	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12623835?location=Benbrook%2C%20TX
