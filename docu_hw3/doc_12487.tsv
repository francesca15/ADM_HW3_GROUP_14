$78	1	Blanco	May 2013	3 blocks from the Blanco Square, 45 miles from San Antonio and Austin, 30 miles from Fredericksburg and numerous wineries, within an hour from several state parks too! The house is a work in progress. We have fresh paint on the the walls and floor and a brand new floor in the second bedroom. The house is being renovated so there isn't trim in all the rooms and the outside isn't fully done (see photo). The house is comfortable and cozy with everything you need to cook a full meal and unwind.	30.0991730811648	-98.4233132365233	Cherry Street Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11892608?location=Blanco%2C%20TX
