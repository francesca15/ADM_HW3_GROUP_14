$30	1	Austin	November 2016	My place is close to South Austin, South Lamar Blvd., Zilker Park, 6th Street, IH - 35, MoPac (Loop 1), shopping, theaters, and many great restaurants.   Youâ€™ll love my place because of the comfy queen-size bed with memory-foam topper, the light, the large kitchen, the outdoors space and the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	30.193092303412598	-97.8277031659484	Cute Room in South Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17479226?location=Buda%2C%20TX
