$75	1	Houston	April 2013	We live in a 1920's character home in EaDo (East Downtown) Houston. We love the proximity of our home to downtown -- short walk or Uber ride to Minute Maid Park, the Metro Rail, Dynamo Stadium and the convention center. East Downtown is an amazing neighborhood with new Houston hotspots opening every week!	29.7541629395603	-95.3454287242847	Private Room+Bath - Walk everywhere	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16907946?location=Alvin%2C%20TX
