$160	3	Del Valle	April 2016	My neighborhood is right off highway 71 and very close to the COTA race track. I've rented out my bedrooms during Formula One and now looking to rent it out more often for other COTA events. Great location if you need a break from the track!	30.167878347206504	-97.62768326530599	Near COTA Race Track	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12367808?location=Cedar%20Creek%2C%20TX
