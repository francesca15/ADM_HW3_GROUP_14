$34	1	San Antonio	May 2012	I am new to the area, just moved from the SF Bay Area with my little terrier but have been a Airbnb host for years. This three bedroom home was built in the 1940s and has been updated with open floor plan and high ceilings. Very basic...clean bedrooms with a queen sized bed and closet space. Conveniently located near 10 freeway. Walking distance to restaurant and a sports bar that makes killer burgers.
