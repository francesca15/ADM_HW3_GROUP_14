$300	3	Kaufman	December 2015	It's a perfect Ranch House for an awesome gateway for family or friends. You'll love this place because of the outdoors and secluded space. We've bunch of animals on the property Llamas, Alpacas, Geese, and a couple of ponies; they all are friendly &amp; they usually roam around the property. This place is good for couples, solo adventurers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets). We haven't rented the property yet so all the stuff is new (mattress , sheets, TV, kitchen equipment, etc.)	32.5597476608669	-96.1096763945643	Ranch House in Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13125311?location=Corsicana%2C%20TX
