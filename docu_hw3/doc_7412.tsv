$149	3	Plano	February 2016	My place is close to restaurants and dining, easy highway access and towards the middle of the city. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the all recents updates I did in October 2016, all new custom flooring, interior freshly painted, new appliances and furniture, new bedroom sets, the high ceilings, the location, the views, the backyard oasis with custom built gazebo, pool and hot tub.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	33.0564400371795	-96.71352397535921	House with Backyard Oasis	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14106676?location=Celina%2C%20TX
