$89	1	Burnet	July 2016	The guest house is situated on a working ranch only 2 miles outside of town, perfect in case you need to run into town but also great because it is very peaceful and quiet. Were only 30 minutes from lakes LBJ, Marble falls, Horseshoe Bay and 15 minutes from lakes Buchanan and Inks. We have two beds in the bedroom along with a pullout sofa in the living room. The interior is very clean and well kept. The backyard is very big with a nice outdoor fireplace, grill and washer boards for you to enjoy.	30.790890400795497	-98.2442672370823	Ranch Guest House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13867403?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
