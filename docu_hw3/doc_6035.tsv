$77	Studio	Austin	November 2015	This is a great location in famous Hyde Park to start your Austin adventure! It's outside of downtown enough that you'll get good sleep, but still close to everything that's going on. There are many excellent bars and restaurants in this part of town including Hopdoddy, Uchiko, Taco Deli, Maudie's, Draught House, Antonelli's, Food Heads, Central Market (better than Whole Foods), and much more!	30.308541238247198	-97.729736305779	Happy in the Heart of Hyde Park	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19205496?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
