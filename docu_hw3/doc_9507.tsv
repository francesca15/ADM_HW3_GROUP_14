$175	3	Leander	February 2016	Deep in the heart of Texas, just 35 minutes from downtown Austin is a one of a kind gathering place.   An inspired mixture of cozy French villa and cowboy bunkhouse.   Sit on the porch and watch the cows and horses play in the nearby pasture.  Great vacation or staycation spot!	30.5672956284522	-97.91199365778499	Austin Hill Country Bunkhouse	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11178212?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
