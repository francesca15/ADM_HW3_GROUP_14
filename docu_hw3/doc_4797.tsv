$45	1	Irving	June 2016	My beautifully remodeled house is close to the airport (8.7 miles), the Irving Mall (3.8 miles), and plenty of great restaurants. The private bedroom accommodates up to two guests with a queen size bed. A little more than $15 for an uber ride from the DFW airport. Washer and dryer included as well as full kitchen. Free wi/fi. We have 4 bedrooms. I stay in one of the bedrooms and I have a roommate in the other bedroom. We are quiet and keep to ourselves but can be social.	32.8119641382233	-96.96639605549672	Updated Modern House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16225510?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
