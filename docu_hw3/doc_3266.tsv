$22	1	Converse	October 2016	This room is in a house that is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Two city parks are close by - one within walking distance (great for dog walking). It is close to San Antonio's bus system, and in both Uber and Lyft service areas. San Antonio airport is a 15 minute drive, and downtown San Antonio is less than 30 minutes. There are lots of dine-in and fast-food restaurants within a few miles. This place is best for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).	29.5297333308791	-98.3292235685779	Quiet Comfort, guest room w/queen bed & bathroom	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15394842?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
