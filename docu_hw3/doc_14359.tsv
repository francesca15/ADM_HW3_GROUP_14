$200	3	Austin	March 2015	Do you like the smell of freshly baked scones? You will enjoy that when checking into my home. My place is homey, airy and full of character. The modern ambiance, the outdoors space, the comfy beds, the peaceful neighborhood, the overall feel makes it a perfect place for a getaway for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. We are very close to Barton Creek and hiking, bike and running trails. In no time at Barton Creek Mall and downtown. The best of both worlds.	30.276428435215696	-97.8445389554837	Lost Creek contemporary Charmer close to downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13471658?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
