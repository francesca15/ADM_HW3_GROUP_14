$73	1	Alpine	July 2015	Located in the heart of downtown Alpine Texas this private ground level loft-style unit is the perfect place to scout out the city, explore the surrounding towns of Marfa and Fort Davis, and discover the beauty of Big Bend National Park. The building was constructed between 1908 and 1912 and features original tin ceilings, and funky plaster! Bed is a queen, the little futon is 3/4 size. And the TV is fairly ancient, so step out the door and enjoy the courtyard!	30.357419478529803	-103.659971262334	Cozy Comfortable Loft 3 in Alpine!!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7530031?location=Alpine%2C%20TX
