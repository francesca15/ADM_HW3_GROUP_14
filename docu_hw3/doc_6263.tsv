$109	3	Euless	August 2016	With our upcoming wedding upon us, we are opening up our 2nd floor of our new home to guests seeking close access to DFW airport, Cowboy Stadium, and Rangers stadium. We would love to meet new people and this seemed like the best way possible and be able to help fund that honeymoon! We will be onsite as well as our dogs, but we don't go upstairs to the listed space unless you need us.	32.8120345884813	-97.10891512979059	Private 2nd floor in new Plantation Builders home.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14918653?location=Colleyville%2C%20TX
