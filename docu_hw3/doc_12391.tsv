$145	1	Wimberley	March 2012	Do you ever daydream about jumping in a travel trailer and heading west? Are you enamored with the vintage style of a bygone era? Do you enjoy camping, but secretly wish you had a real bed, wifi and a bathroom? If so, the Dixie Daisy is for you! This cute Airstream trailer has been completely renovated with a retro twist. It’s the perfect place to escape for a relaxing weekend surrounded by nature, yet equipped with the conveniences of home. Grill up a yummy dinner with your honey and dine al fresco on the large deck, take a morning stroll along the creek, turn on the string lights for some mood lighting, take a dip in the hot tub, enjoy your morning shower under the trees in the private, spacious outdoor shower (room for two!), and end your day relaxing by the fire with an ice cold beer. This is the life!   The Dixie Daisy provides all the comforts of home in one cute, cozy package. The antique iron bedframe holds a queen mattress, the bathroom has a small interior shower and a real toilet, the kitchen is fully equipped with dishes and utensils, and alongside the deck is a charcoal grill and fire bowl for your night-time fire. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as leaving fresh eggs in the fridge (as long as the chickens keep up) and local organic coffee. They also strive to make this property as green as possible by using environmentally friendly dish soap and laundry detergent, providing recycled paper products and full recycling, using low-wattage light bulbs, and more.  This cozy retreat is nestled in an elm grove along the banks of Smith Creek on 10 beautiful acres shared with the owners. You’ll really feel like you’ve escaped to nature, yet the fabulous shopping and dining of downtown Wimberley are only 3 miles down the road. It’s the best of both worlds! So, what are you waiting for? The Dixie Daisy is the unique getaway you’ve been dreaming of. We are confident that it will exceed your expectations!  Pet policy: Pets are allowed for a fee of $50 per pet, and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended that they be crated and that they remain on leash when wandering the property if they might be inclined to chase a child, cat, or chicken or wander off. Thanks for understanding!  Single night bookings:  We have a two night minimum, but when there is a single night gap in the schedule we are happy to accept a single night booking for an additional $25. Just shoot us a message with your date and we'll go from there.  We strive to give our guests as much privacy as possible, but you may see us from time to time during your stay. We love to meet our guests, so don't hesitate to strike up a conversation!	30.0092194535175	-98.05743424290671	Super Cute Retro Airstream	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/577410?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
