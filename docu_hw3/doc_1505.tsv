$63	2	Austin	May 2016	Open concept kitchen and concrete everywhere...floors, counters, shower  and baseboards. If you don't like concrete you won't like this house :) Large living area and two bedrooms with queen beds. I like my house so you might be jealous of me having it but you will enjoy the stay anyway. Drive way parking, oh yeah that's concrete too. A nice backyard and porch. Picture s don't show furnishings, but I promise they will be there.	30.387549370625898	-97.65750990960709	2-1 sweetness	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18269784?location=Austin%2C%20TX
