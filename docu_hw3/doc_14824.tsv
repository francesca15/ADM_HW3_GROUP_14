$140	1	Austin	January 2017	The luxury 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment will be entirely yours. No one physically lives here - this is run like a hotel with a full-time cleaning crew. If there is anything you would to request before your arrival let us know!  Located just blocks from UT and about 20 blocks from downtown (easy biking distance, or there is a bus stop 1 block away). This is an apartment that we use to host international professors/scholars coming to UT, and when we have open dates we'd love to host you!	30.294026580468802	-97.72237883334351	31 - Luxury Apt 1 Bdrm-1Bath Apt University Park	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17569753?location=Austin%2C%20TX
