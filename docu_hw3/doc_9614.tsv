$800	3	Buda	July 2012	I have the perfect location for you if you are looking for a place to rent while in town for Formula 1 or SXSW and the rental price has recently been greatly reduced. My house is less than 4 years old and is in Whispering Hollow subdivision in Buda, Texas. We are located very close to downtown Austin as well as the conveniences of the town of Buda and a very large shopping center that has everything you might need for your stay. The house is a 2100 sq. foot home with three bedrooms and two baths. I only have beds in two bedrooms. One is a queen size bed and the other is a king size bed. The other bedroom can accommodate a roll away bed if you need me to pick one up for you. I also have two couches and three recliners that are all comfortable to sleep in. There is enough open floor space to put down sleeping bags if needed. I have cable TV and a large driveway for parking.  The garage will be off limits and will be locked so you will not be able to use that space. I love my home. I am a retired school teacher/coach, so I really enjoy my time at this home. I think you will enjoy having me as your host as I am very easy to get in touch with and I will remain in Austin during your stay so you can contact me at anytime for assistance. I can give you directions to any sites you might be interested in seeing on your visit. I can also be available to transport you anywhere you would like to go, including the race track or to a location where they transport you to the track. I am available for pickup and delivery to the airport.	30.0901754317408	-97.86552192268971	Near Austin-Great for Formula 1	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/620927?location=Buda%2C%20TX
