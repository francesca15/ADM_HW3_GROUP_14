$131	2	Austin	July 2016	My place is close to Magnolia Cafe South, Once Over Coffee Bar, Fair Bean Coffee. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location and the coziness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).Great Travis Heights / South Congress house. Perfect location in a quiet neighborhood yet close to downtown, shopping on South Congress is just a couple blocks away. Great restaurants, a jogging trail and park with public swimming pool right around the corner.	30.2450010990307	-97.7475290167358	SOUTH CONGRESS 2 BEDROOM HOUSE	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14243071?location=Austin%2C%20TX
