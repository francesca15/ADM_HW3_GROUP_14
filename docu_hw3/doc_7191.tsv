$58	1	Houston	February 2015	This space is actually the master bedroom in a 1912 bungalow in Houston's number one historic district. The area is one of the hottest areas in Houston attracting new residents like us, the children of baby boomer suburbanites. In contrast to 50 years ago, the majority of these young, new residents are not moving to Houston Heights to build new homes but to restore the historic homes built by others. Close-in living -- only a short distance from work, cultural centers and restaurants!	29.7818778516212	-95.3806041626486	Home Suite Home in the Heights Historic District	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12006259?location=Baytown%2C%20TX
