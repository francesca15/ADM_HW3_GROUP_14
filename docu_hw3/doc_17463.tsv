$34	1	Austin	February 2013	Great place for visits to UT!  This is a 1-bed 1-bath apartment with a den. You'll have the bedroom to yourself and we'll share the bathroom if I'm home. You can use the kitchen and feel free to use any pots/pans/dishes.  I have a cat, FYI.  I'm located just north of the University of Texas (UT). I'm also within walking distance of downtown although I advise wearing comfortable walking shoes if you plan on walking. You can also take the bus, which is easy to access.	30.293365112278103	-97.7355401839501	Apartment conveniently close to UT and downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17418750?location=Austin%2C%20TX
