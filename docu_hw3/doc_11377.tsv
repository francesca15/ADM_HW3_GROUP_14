$139	1	Terlingua	September 2016	This property offers an up-close experience with nature alongside a lot of solitude. We recommend a high clearance vehicle for this type of terrain. This home is great for creative projects! We do have a bathroom and you will only be 3.5 miles from Terlingua Ranch Headquarters where you will have access to bath houses, a pool, laundry mat, cafe/restaurant and a recreation room. Its a beautiful 40 minute drive to the National Park.	29.4938173335266	-103.433654466737	Off-grid Camp of Solitude with Mountain	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14587046?location=Big%20Bend%20National%20Park%2C%20TX
