$150	3	Malakoff	August 2016	This A-frame, oasis is a perfect retreat for a family or friends looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. The private, salt water pool is shaded by pine trees. The house sits on an acre of land and feels somewhat secluded. Located less than 400 yards from the lake and a private dock where you can spend the morning fishing or reading. Nothing says vacation like this sweet little house. We hope you will enjoy it as much as we do!	32.231579438126005	-96.0052917676928	A-frame Oasis	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17866204?location=Cedar%20Creek%20Reservoir%2C%20TX
