$58	1	Fort Worth	January 2015	Centrally located 3.4 miles from TCU and 4.4 miles from downtown. You'll love my place because of the comfy queen bed with additional trundle bed for other guests but all are in the same bedroom. The den is cozy with a love seat and a chair seating 3. The kitchen seats 4 at the table. Kitchen &amp; Bath were totally gutted and remodeled along w new windows and HVAC. I personally selected the furnishings w comfort in mind.The garage apartment is located up a flight of stairs over the garage.	32.7383402574058	-97.3846987437226	Arlington Heights garage apartment off I-30	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16423642?location=Benbrook%2C%20TX
