$253	2	Corpus Christi	December 2015	I love the clean atmosphere, and bedding decor; color and feel are 'beach' which adds to atmosphere. Living space is large, clean, and quiet. Thick walls, so I don't worry about my loud family bothering neighbors. Sand cleans from floors easily.	27.603672972799	-97.22394110239028	Pool Front Townhouse at Palm Bay	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10151498?location=Baffin%20Bay%2C%20TX
