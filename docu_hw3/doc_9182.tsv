$119	3	Georgetown	June 2016	My place is close to San Gabriel River Trail, and a short drive to Downtown Georgetown. Youâ€™ll love my place because of huge fenced in backyard, with swing and fire pit and outdoor seating. There are two kids bedrooms, with toys for boys and girls. A fully functional kitchen with updated gas stove. Large desk area for getting work done and high speed internet. My place is good for families (with kids) and furry friends (pets).	30.653362154858105	-97.69130083946828	Cute, Cozy Home for Kids and Dogs	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13492356?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
