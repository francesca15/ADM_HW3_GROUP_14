$125	3	Denton	May 2016	My cozy little house with hardwood floors is close to the city center, parks, and restaurants. You'll love my place because of the coziness, the high ceilings, the quiet neighborhood and the back patio with fire pit. My place is good for couples, business travelers, and families (with kids).	33.1434200986208	-97.1178219846919	Cozy home in quiet neighborhood	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13019709?location=Argyle%2C%20TX
