$95	1	Austin	August 2011	Our apartment is perfect for the budget traveler. It's very clean and with about 500 square feet it is spacious enough for 2 guests, although there is a fold out couch if you need it. My wife and I lived here before buying the main house on the property. It was a great place to live and gave us many happy years. I'm sure you will love it too!  Located near Congress and Riverside, just a few blocks away from longtime Austin establishments such as Guero's Taco Bar, The Continental Club, Allen's Boots, and many other amazing restaurants, shops and music venues. The South Congress bridge, where the bats emerge at sunset every evening from March to October, is just a few more blocks away and leads directly into the downtown area only a mile from our apartment, all within walking distance. You can pick up the hike and bike trail at the bridge as well, and it runs for many miles around Lady Bird Lake. Public bike rentals are within a five minute walk on Congress Avenue.  We do provide off street parking for one car.   Rate includes 15% state and local hotel taxes for stays shorter than 30 days.   We may or may not be here when you arrive but we will make sure to leave the door unlocked and the apartment ready for you when you get here.  Our neighborhood is very quiet but still within a five minute walk to South Congress Avenue where business is booming!  There is public transportation within a five minute walk on Congress Avenue.  I have the best wifi range extender that money can buy but I have heard from our guests that it can be a little spotty, especially in the back of the apartment further away from our house. We do apologize in advance for any inconvenience. I am looking into ways to run a physical line from the house to the apartment but this is a fairly major project that will have to take place sometime in 2017.	30.247760970391603	-97.7452720928109	South Congress Studio Apartment	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/202187?location=Brazos%20River%2C%20TX
