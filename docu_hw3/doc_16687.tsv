$105	1	Fulshear	December 2016	Our guest cabin is located on our 40 acre horse farm in beautiful Fulshear, Texas.  The farm is covered with century old pecan trees, and is a peaceful oasis from the city, without being too far away. It is close to highly rated restaurants, neat shops, and the popular Fulshear cycling routes.  It is a 25 minute drive via I-10 to the Houston Energy Corridor, and 35 min via the Westpark Tollway to downtown Houston.	29.7053112871665	-95.9462244949632	Treehouse Farm Guest Cabin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16692891?location=Beasley%2C%20TX
