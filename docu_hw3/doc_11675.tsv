$190	2	South Padre Island	March 2016	ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT!! NOT QUITE THE PENTHOUSE, but close as we could get! The penthouses are on the tenth floor - we couldn't afford a penthouse...chances are you can't either if this is your budget!. Great views of paradise overlooking the gulf from this Aquarius beachfront, 9th floor unit. Watch sunrise on the gulf and soon Space-X launches from living room balcony. Located directly on the Gulf of Mexico. Sandy and I stay often in our units and update them constantly.	26.1001019414363	-97.16283001582791	AQUARIUS 906 PENTHOUSE PARADISE	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12910108?location=Brownsville%2C%20TX
