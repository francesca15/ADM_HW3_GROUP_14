$80	2	Fort Worth	June 2016	Thanks for checking out our home in Arlington Heights. It was built in the early 1900s but has all the amenities of a modern smart home. We offer a quiet escape from the hustle of downtown while only being 1.5mi from all the action of 7th street &amp; the cultural district.	32.7354997555018	-97.3810514385939	Cute and comfy stay in quaint Arlington Heights	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17010215?location=Azle%2C%20TX
