$33	Studio	Bryan	November 2014	Wonderful studio apartment, with one bed and an additional futon couch. Located in Historic Downtown Bryan, there are many great restaurants and bars within walking distance. This is a perfect stay for visitors to Texas A&amp;M University, as it is a 10 minute drive away. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Great weekend and gameday getaway!!	30.6735425964777	-96.3741647658617	Downtown Bryan Studio - Texas A&M	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16136813?location=Bryan%2C%20TX
