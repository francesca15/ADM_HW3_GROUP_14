$67	2	Dallas	April 2015	This little two bedroom, one bath 1940's cottage is warm and cozy! With a feel for laid back California, Mid Century Modern kicks. Have a fun night at home cooking in the open modern updated kitchen or head out back and do some grilling and relaxing one the deck with the cactus gardens and warming cafe lights. With White Rock Lake only 3 blocks away start your day with either a jog or grab the bikes and cruz around.	32.8237177479411	-96.71004046702959	Home Sweet Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18427226?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
