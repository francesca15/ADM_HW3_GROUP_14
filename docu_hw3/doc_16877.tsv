$36	1	Frisco	July 2016	My place is walking distance to many restaurants, a Kroger Store, bank, dry cleaners, gyms, nail salons, Starbucks, ER Urgent Care, etc. There's literally everything near by. Right across the street there's a park with a jogging path.   My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. We're a friendly family of 3, husband travels a lot so most of the time it's just 2 of us. Myself and our 5 y/o daughter. We're respectful and laid back. Attached garage space available.	33.1766569545605	-96.7432041900248	Big house, quiet location, park across the street	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14123798?location=Anna%2C%20TX
