$90	1	Bee Cave	April 2014	Cozy small but quaint bedroom with en suite small bathroom with toilet, sink, shower/bath combo. Queen size comfy bed. We call this the cave room, as it is nestled in the corner of the house with a small window. Very quiet and dark, makes it a very comfortable nights sleep.  We have 3 rooms available in our home - all together on the second floor. Which makes it great if you have 1 or more other travelers that need their own queen size bed.
