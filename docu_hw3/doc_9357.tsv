$40	1	Houston	February 2015	1 mile away from the NRG Stadium. Perfect for all NRG related functions. In the Medical Center Close to Downtown, with great views, restaurants and dining, family-friendly activities, and nightlife close by. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the hosts, its a chill and relaxed environment! The neighborhood is ideal.  It's the right location, amount of privacy, safety, space, and the price is right! :) Great for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and groups.	29.6708710430925	-95.4255961218832	Tucked away Oasis with a Private Balcony	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15804746?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
