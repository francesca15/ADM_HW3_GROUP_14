$30	2	Pilot Point	June 2017	Our home is in a cozy RV park outside of Denton, TX! It's a great, quite park with a washer and dryer building and nice neighbors! We are only 15 miles from the colorful, hip city of Denton! The RV is fully loaded with all kitchen appliances, bath necessities, wifi connection, and your own outdoor space! It's small, but functional and serves as a great simple getaway from the big city, yet close enough to enjoy it's amenities!	33.3309041819589	-96.9029113861196	RV Simple Living	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19470138?location=Aubrey%2C%20TX
