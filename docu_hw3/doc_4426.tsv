$115	1	Morgan	January 2016	My place is a few minutes drive in the neighborhood to the lake and is great for enjoying small wildlife including deer and foxes, and offers plenty of quiet relaxation. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the woodsy surroundings, the warm and cozy rustic cabin and the peaceful neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	31.9384028311208	-97.4544317185314	Quiet, Cozy, Rustic Cabin in the Woods	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15233373?location=Clifton%2C%20TX
