$47	1	Austin	February 2011	My place is close to the airport, and Southpark Meadows - with literally hundreds of stores, restaurants, theaters, and bars only 2 miles away. Downtown is only about a 10 minute commute as is the airport. Youâ€™ll love my place especially if you've ever considered buying a trailer, this is your chance to find out if one's right for you! And it's gotta country feel with all the extras, while still close to everything Austin. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	30.151077058393398	-97.7648331952099	Brand New!
