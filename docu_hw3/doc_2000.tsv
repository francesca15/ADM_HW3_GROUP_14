$400	4	Rockport	May 2016	My place is close to the marina and is located in the middle of Key Allegro and very close to Aransas Bay.. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the beautiful views from both front and back balconies. You can dock your boat in the back on Dolphin Canal and fish at your leisure. My place is good for couples, families (with kids), and big groups.	28.038154040111998	-97.02775937627109	The Blue Marlin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13164178?location=Bayside%2C%20TX
