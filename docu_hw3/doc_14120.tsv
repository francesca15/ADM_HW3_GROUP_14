$500	3	Del Valle	December 2013	Comfortable, spacious and quiet 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath home sits on an acre and is located 4.5 mile from COTA, minutes from the airport, Austin, South Congress (SoCo), 6th Street, Bastrop and a short drive to the beautiful Hill Country. You have full access to the entire property, however, I will likely be staying in the camper at the back of the property as to tend to the pets. I am happy to provide transportation to and from the track if it's conducive to my work schedule. Welcome and enjoy!	30.106613936056103	-97.5752448051399	5 mi to Circuit of the Americas F1	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7756740?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
