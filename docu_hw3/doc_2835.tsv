$45	1	Lewisville	December 2016	My place is close to Highway 35E. Youâ€™ll love my place because of easy access to anywhere in the city, just 35 minutes from downtown Dallas you'll find the commute very easy. There's a number of gas stations, fast food restaurants, and dine-in spots within a 10 to 15 mile radius. The community is also very quiet and family place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	33.0552393873431	-97.0322079187796	Modern little space in Lewisville	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16215451?location=Corinth%2C%20TX
