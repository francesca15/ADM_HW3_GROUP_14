$45	1	Houston	March 2013	This is the home I grew up in and it's very sentimental. It's a mid 1960's ranch style home. I live between this house and my place in NYC. The house is close to all shopping, The Galleria, Medical Center, The Rice Village, Downtown etc. Very cool part of town.	29.6648302806816	-95.4882545178335	Serene room in urban suburb	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11679410?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
