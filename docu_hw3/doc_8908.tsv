$110	1	Canyon Lake	March 2017	Bell's Cottage is a hidden treasure in a secluded neighborhood, only minutes away from Canyon Lake. We are close to all the attractions but far enough away for piece and quiet. With abundant wild life and centrally located between Austin and San Antonio. Just a short drive to Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels, the Guadalupe river, Wimberley, Fredricksburg and Luckenbach. We have a variety of restaurants to choose from and a Brookshire grocery to pick up your last minute items.	29.921162012463004	-98.2871954954096	Bell's Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17827588?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
