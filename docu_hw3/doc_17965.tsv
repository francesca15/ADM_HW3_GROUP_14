$165	3	Dallas	August 2013	Pleasant 3bdrm home centrally located with easy access to downtown. Perfect for a family or friends ok with piling in together. Quick access to Dallas love airport and less than 20mins to DFW. Great for those who get stranded at DAL  This is NOT the house for you if you are a local looking to party for one night. I do not do one night reservations anymore over the weekend for this reason.	32.8771344812899	-96.86328393723329	Dallas Love	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11995979?location=Addison%2C%20TX
