$440	4	Wimberley	May 2012	Unique home, pristine setting, incredible community. Recently remodeled with special attention to the use of materials that are energy efficient, non toxic, and aesthetically pleasing. The focus on conservation is evident throughout with hand crafted counters of recycled glass and resin, reclaimed wood floors and trim, volcanic limestone and resin tub, and more. The incorporation of antiques in the cabinets, stained glass windows, and individually selected doors create a timeless appeal. The recycled theme is carried through to the art, with a stunning school of fish individually sculpted out of aluminum cans, and the custom furniture which includes a dining room table made from a 150 year old mission door.   While there is much to appreciate in the interior construction, it's the view that captures you. The home sits on a limestone bluff directly over the river with water views from almost every room in the house. The water is deep enough to paddle board and is perfect for tubing when the river is flowing. You can rest your lounge chair in the shallow water on the banks and relax to the soothing sounds of the rapids when you're through with your swim.   Hard to imagine a place this serene can also be convenient, but the location is unbeatable. We're a mile from town, Blue Hole Regional Park, and Wimberley's renown outdoor theater, The Corral. Jacob's Well is just a few minutes away. Fiber Arts enthusiasts will love Old Oaks Ranch. Live music and is always available in town, at the Whitewater Ampitheater or other nearby locations. In addition to all there is to do here, Wimberley is the perfect location to stay while you plan day trips to outlying areas. Head out on a hill country wine or barbecue tour, visit Hamilton Pool, tube the Guadalupe in New Braunfels, take in Gruene and the oldest dance hall in Texas, tour LBJ's boyhood home in Johnson City, or spend the day at America's largest water park, Schlitterbahn. Wimberley is home to many artists and musicians and there are opportunities to attend a variety of shows year round. San Antonio is only an hour away with The Alamo, 6 Flags, the zoo and more, or head 45 minutes north to Austin, the Live Music Capitol of the World!  The well stocked kitchen with professional cookware, gas stove, and every imaginable appliance will delight any cook. The enormous master suite is divine with it's cathedral ceiling, inviting decor and a bathroom to rival any spa. The architecture features high ceilings throughout with a 30 foot ceiling in the living room wrapped in wood.   There are no carpets, drapes or indoor plants to aggravate allergies. However, pets are on the property.  There is a greenhouse with an aquaponic system. You're welcome to partake of the current selection of organic produce.  We love this community and will gladly help tailor your stay to include your interests. No doubt, you will be enchanted, too.  The Blanco River, fire pit, horseshoe pit, a few tubes for the river, and admission to any barn concerts if they coincide with your stay.  As much or as little as you prefer.  The location is EXTREMELY convenient but tranquil. We have the river behind the house and ranches across the street. The grocery store is 1.5 miles away, and the Coral Outdoor Theatre is just down the road. Flite Acres is truly one of the most desirable streets in Wimberley.  There is no public transit. But you can rent horses down the road!	29.987110730141897	-98.0834972997587	GALLERY on the Blanco in Wimberley	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/558177?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
