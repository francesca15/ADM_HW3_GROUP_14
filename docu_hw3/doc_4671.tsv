$50	2	Fairview	January 2016	Our comfy place is a football field away from the popular Villages of Fairview with tons of places to eat. There is also a TopGolf and Cabellas nearby. Even better is we're right across from the legendary Allen Outlet Mall. Just look it up :-) Plenty of running trails around town too. Peaceful community with the option of having a good and crazy time. Ipic movie theatre and splitsville bowling alley are the first places you see right outside the gate.	33.1337624967592	-96.64794633512791	Cozy Apt in Fairview, near McKinney and Allen	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18166869?location=Celina%2C%20TX
