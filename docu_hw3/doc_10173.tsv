$199	1	Llano	June 2017	The Zinfandel Room is located on the second floor overlooking the south part of the vineyard. Weâ€™ve taken our design approach to this room from the spicy foods so well accompanied by Zinfandel wine.  The industrial feel of the furnishings is accented by spicy colors like orange and lime green to create a zesty ambiance sparked by the vintage corrugated tin feature wall.	30.5768215724337	-98.47030314740209	The Vineyard B&B Zinfandel Room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19548101?location=Burnet%2C%20TX
