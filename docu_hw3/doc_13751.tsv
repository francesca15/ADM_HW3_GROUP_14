$110	1	Bee Cave	December 2014	Right across the street from the Hill Country Galleria and 13 miles from downtown. Everything you need is easily accessible. Full bedroom, bath and kitchen. I will allow small dogs to stay as well, but I do ask that you crate them while you are away.	30.3024879349362	-97.9337313961617	1 Bdrm Home Away from Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8000474?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
