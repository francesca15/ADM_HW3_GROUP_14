$90	1	Houston	January 2017	My place is close to nightlife, the city center, NRG Stadium, gayborhood, family-friendly activities, grocery store, shopping center, public transportation, midtown and restaurants that are open late. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location, decor, and amenities. Located in one of Houston's most happening neighborhoods, it's wholly accessible to NRG stadium. Additionally, I've never waited for more than a couple of minutes for an Uber to arrive and whisk me away to my destination.	29.7340555178507	-95.4002976297431	Charming 1 Bedroom, 1 Bath Apt.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16895384?location=Alvin%2C%20TX
