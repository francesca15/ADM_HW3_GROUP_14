$102	1	Austin	October 2013	Quiet, top-floor corner unit walking distance to the Convention Center, S. Congress, and downtown (SXSW). Right on the Town Lake trail &amp; walking distance to Zilker Park. Enjoy hanging on the rooftop with an amazing view of downtown. Tons of natural light with blackout curtains in the bedroom for good sleep.  Across the street from my favorite breakfast tacos in town and next door to an organic, fair-trade coffee shop. I use organic detergents for all linens, and hand soaps are organic as well.	30.2563293185139	-97.74645530615558	Downtown-Walk Everywhere!
