$65	1	Dallas	December 2013	My cabin is a hidden gem in Parkdale/Urbandale, a neighborhood only 15 minutes from downtown and filled with unique architecture, old trees, and multicultural flavor. Made from hand-planed cedar, the cabin has a wonderful smell and unique aesthetic. It feels like a woodcutter's home deep in the woods, yet sits safely in my verdant backyard. Covered parking onsite is removed from the road and secure. Come spend a couple of days among the trees!	32.764681336201	-96.69548942614941	Charming Cabin Near Deep Ellum & Fair Park	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15342315?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
