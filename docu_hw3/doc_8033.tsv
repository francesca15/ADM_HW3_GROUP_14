$80	1	Dallas	April 2016	I've always desired a place that promotes positive energy and displays my devotion and love to my family. My apartment has been a place of refuge while traveling as an I.T. Consultant for 3 years, and a place that reminds me why I strive to do good in life everyday.	32.9409376676944	-96.81764577295651	Midtown Living	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13796745?location=Carrollton%2C%20TX
