$35	Studio	New Braunfels	July 2016	This is the same lot as the other. Plenty of room to camp. It is quiet here and very peaceful. A place to really clear your mind. This is a 1 acre campsite. A great place to come after a day on the Guadalupe River, which is just a few miles away. Raw land. No house. There is electric. And if I get enough interest I will get the water turned on.	29.844136047011	-98.14057891753309	1 Acre Camping with Electric off River Road 2	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18999599?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
