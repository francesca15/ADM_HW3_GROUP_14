$74	1	Beaumont	October 2016	Looking for a relaxing downtown vibe w/ unlimited coffee + free WiFi? You've found your spot! My loft accommodates 2 - 3 guests and is dog friendly. I own a Weimaraner that's good w/ all dogs and people (but not cats!). The main living room is where our guests stay (futon or couch w/ bathroom + kitchen + laundry). I mainly stay in my room working, so I won't be a bother. Overall, It's a great place to get away, focus on your work, or take a historical walk in the beautiful downtown atmosphere.	30.080819592156	-94.0976994376367	★ Downtown BMT Lofts ★ “Urban Get Away by River”	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15955896?location=Beaumont%2C%20TX
