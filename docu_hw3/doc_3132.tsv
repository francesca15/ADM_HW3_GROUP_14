$55	1	Dallas	June 2013	This comfy suite is in an older prestigious part of Central Dallas called Preston Hollow. I have lived here over 14 years and the neighborhood is quiet, well-kept and provides easy access to major thoroughfares in Dallas.  The suite is great for the business traveler, someone looking to relocate to Dallas, someone conducting an internship or just on vacation and don't want the hustle and bustle of a hotel.	32.8997349499818	-96.7708003667582	Preston Hollow Comfy Suite	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1860167?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
