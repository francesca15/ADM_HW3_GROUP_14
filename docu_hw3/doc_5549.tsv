$75	1	Katy	November 2016	My place is close to family-friendly activities. There are convenient stores and eateries in our cozy community. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the quiet established neighborhood, comfy bed and private bathroom. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers, especially if you need access to the energy corridor. Avid Golfer? Bring your clubs, the course is a five minute drive away. Our home is close enough to walk or borrow our bikes and stop at the Ice Cream Shop.	29.7563533372112	-95.7565721970441	Comfy Suburban Rm/Queen Bed, w/Private Bath,Wifi	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16690222?location=Cinco%20Ranch%2C%20TX
