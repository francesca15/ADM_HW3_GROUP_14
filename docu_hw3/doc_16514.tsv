$123	1	Freeport	May 2015	My place is close to the beach. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the coziness, the high ceilings, covered and uncovered decks, beach chairs, tent, boogie boards and wagon provided. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	28.955623918986603	-95.2829346215202	Wine Down at Surfside Beach, TX	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17438115?location=Angleton%2C%20TX
