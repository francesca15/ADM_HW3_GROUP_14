$105	1	Cleveland	May 2016	is close to Cleveland, TX, on US 69, about 1 hour east of Houston. Twenty minutes from Cleveland. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the quiet, rural area. Neighbors are around, but not in view. The cabin sits on a small, private lake under large Cypress trees. Abundant wildlife to watch and hear. One bedroom, but also a futon couch on the screened in porch and a fold out twin in the bedroom. Fenced area for pets. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	30.4593182127803	-94.86173186745572	Quiet, rural cabin on private lake in East Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13205298?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
