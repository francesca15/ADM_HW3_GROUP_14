$40	1	Llano	December 2016	Older clap board house with lots of antiques. One block from Main Street of Llano, Lan Tex Movie Theater, Joe's Bar, Fuel Coffee Shop just couple blocks away. Easy walk. Llano River just 100 yards the other way with the falling water going over the dam to heard from the front yard. Great place for swimming, fishing for big catfish below the dam. I also do kayak trips on the Llano river so for an additional fee we can arrange for trips down the river.	30.750264524488102	-98.68044995509979	ZENO'S PLACE IN LLANO, THE FLAG ROOM	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16498431?location=Buchanan%20Dam%2C%20TX
