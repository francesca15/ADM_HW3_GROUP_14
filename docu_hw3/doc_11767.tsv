$65	1	Houston	June 2016	My place is in Midtown, close to downtown, public transportation, parks, art and culture, restaurants and bars. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. It is a perfect base for exploring Houston, and I aim for it to feel like a home away from home.	29.745899315935002	-95.37988668175258	Comfy Room in Midtown Townhouse	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13444630?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
