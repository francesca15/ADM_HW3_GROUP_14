$60	Studio	Fort Worth	November 2013	Perfect place for someone who likes historic districts! We live in Fairmount, a beautiful and versatile early-20th century neighborhood with sidewalks, parks, and friendly neighbors. There is lots to do nearby, whether you want the out-on-the-town night life or the quiet/romantic dining experience.  We are conveniently located in a quiet area just an 8 minute walk from Magnolia St, where there are restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and more. 7th St and Downtown Fort Worth are both 2.5 miles away.	32.7270624892004	-97.33278692153341	Magnolia Studio Apartment	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2243630?location=Benbrook%2C%20TX
