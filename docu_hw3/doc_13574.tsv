$150	2	Grapevine	August 2012	Our place is close to the airport, lots of activities, restaurants, shopping, public transport, nightlife, and the lake. It is very clean and comfortable with many updates. Enjoy a quiet coffee or cocktail on the back deck. It is just an easy walk to the center of Main St. Great for anyone with business at the Gaylord Texan. The Gaylord is about 1 mi and the Cowboy games are about 17mi or 20-30 min. Ask about discounts for longer stays.	32.9375046754051	-97.0737085300252	Pepper B	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13378193?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
