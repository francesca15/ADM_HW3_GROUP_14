$80	1	Bedford	November 2016	My place is close to the airport, the city center, parks, art and culture, and great views. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, the high ceilings, the views, the location, and the people. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	32.8362942175179	-97.1376577072175	Super 8- DFW Airport west AT&T Cowboys	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16257986?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
