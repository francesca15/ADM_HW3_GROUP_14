$39	1	Irving	April 2016	The Best Rest! is a private bedroom in a two-story home. The house is very spacious and open. My guests stay upstairs, and my family stays downstairs. The location is very convenient - we are near every major highway in DFW and the Las Colinas business area. The home is near restaurants, grocery stores, running trails and minutes to DFW airport. My place is very family friendly. You will enjoy the open space and high ceilings.	32.9183861505958	-96.9507758384248	Best Rest! w/ All Essentials/QueenBed Amazon Alexa	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16230502?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
