$225	4	Montalba	February 2017	Our place is located between Athens and Palestine, Texas. Both cities have great restaurants, antique shopping and outdoor activities. Places like the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center, the East Texas Arboretum and Canton Trading Days are all close by. Youâ€™ll love the house as it has plenty of space to relax for families and 250 acres to wonder. The house is great for couples and families (with kids), and groups. There are three ponds on the property as well as a ravine to explore.	31.856751230177803	-95.7509271379223	Ranch House sleeps 13 with 250 acres to explore	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17176028?location=Athens%2C%20TX
