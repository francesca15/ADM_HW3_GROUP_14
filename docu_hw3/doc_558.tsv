$375	4	Lakehills	October 2016	My place is close to great views of Medina Lake.. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the waterfront location.. My place is good for couples, families (with kids), big groups, and furry friends (pets). Our updated waterfront home is the perfect place to spend your relaxing vacation or weekend getaway. Meals are a breeze in the stocked modern kitchen or you can use the propane BBQ and enjoy outdoor dining on the deck.	29.575105477681397	-98.9180923431333	Medina Lake Waterfront Home - Dock, SUPs, Kayaks	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15672018?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
