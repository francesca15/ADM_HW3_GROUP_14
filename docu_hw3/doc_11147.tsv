$250	4	Buda	March 2011	We are only 30 minutes from downtown Austin and would make a great place to crash for anyone visiting Austin. We have one king size bed, two full beds, one with a trundle bed, a large couch and an inflatable mattress. Our back yard is huge and would be a great place to recharge.	30.109803381035	-97.86198145036622	Large House South of Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14980376?location=Buda%2C%20TX
