$49	Studio	Austin	May 2014	Tiny House 814 is at the Community First Village, a 27-acre master planned community for the homeless in East Austin. There is a nearby individual-style bathhouse. Gardens, chickens, donkeys, bees, blacksmithing, timberframing and more are all happening right outside your window. I also encourage you to contact us about volunteering in one of our onsite micro-enterprises for a story to tell your friends about. We are a Village for the chronically homeless that is visited by thousands annually.	30.2814696472611	-97.6226843671268	Tiny House 814 at the MLF Community First Village	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17625957?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
