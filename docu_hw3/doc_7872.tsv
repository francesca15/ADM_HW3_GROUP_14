$150	2	Wimberley	November 2014	Much like our Cabin at Rough Creek, the Bunkhouse was built as a hunting cabin. Recently remodeled, this small, yet comfortable space, is available to those who want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and spend some time in the Hill Country on the ranch (approximately 15 min. from town). You have the opportunity to see wildlife, walk around the property in front of the Bunkhouse, the arenas &amp; along the creek and enjoy the peace and quiet where there is always a nice breeze.	30.055145366550303	-98.1713042001552	The Bunkhouse at Rough Creek-country comfort	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4659810?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
