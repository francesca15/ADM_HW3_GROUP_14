$22	1	San Antonio	April 2015	My place is close to the airport. The bed is located in the front room but is closed off from the rest of the house and people traffic. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood and the kitchen. My place is good for solo adventurers.  Private room for rent, located in an established neighborhood with quick access to Loop 410, US 281 and IH-35. Only 5 minutes from the airport, 10 minutes to BAMC, and 15 to the UTHSCSA. It's perfect for anyone visiting for a short stay.	29.5200790506943	-98.45505578224069	Airport Trundle bed with shared bath	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13276148?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
