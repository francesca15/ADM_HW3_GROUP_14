$55	1	Kingsland	April 2016	Our place is close to Lake LBJ in the beautiful Texas Hill Country. Fifty miles from Fredericksburg, and fifty miles from Austin. There are lots of State Parks close by as well as plenty of other sights to see.   My husband, Keith, and I enjoy motorcycling through the beautiful Texas Hill Country. Keith is retired US Air Force. I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up! We have seven grown/college age children as well as two grandsons.	30.6504813963609	-98.4706387549394	Texas Hill Country Rustic Suite	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13435100?location=Buchanan%20Dam%2C%20TX
