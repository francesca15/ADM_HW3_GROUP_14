$43	1	Houston	June 2017	Great for business, pleasure, or anything in between! Open to anyone regardless of your background or beliefs :) Also a perfect location, 3 minutes (driving) from the Galleria, but far enough to get a good night sleep without the noise of the city. We are two recent graduates working on our startup, so we'll be out and about the majority of the time. Our community includes: resort-style pool, Jacuzzi, a 24/7 gym, and many more included amenities! A great location at a convenient cost!	29.7431044500093	-95.4791054183447	Galleria - Cozy Bedroom in Gated Luxury Apartments	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19143992?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
