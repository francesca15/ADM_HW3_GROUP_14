$125	2	Freeport	January 2017	My place is close to the beach. Youâ€™ll love my place because it's more than just enjoying the beach. It's for nice walks on the beach or jetty, evening bomb fires, some time to just relax and unwind. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	28.945021455847698	-95.29236790228491	Cloud Nine beach cottage 1 hour drive from Houston	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16894379?location=Angleton%2C%20TX
