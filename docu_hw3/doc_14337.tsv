$400	2	Houston	January 2017	Very close to the big game! Nice, quiet neighborhood. Walking distance from downtown!  Close to many restaurants &amp; popular after hour events  Replies very quickly for any questions or help!  Ubers &amp; cabs are very popular &amp; frequent in this area  My beautiful place is 6 miles from the NRG Stadium! 12 minutes away. My place is also located 2minutes from Downtown Houston &amp; Discovery Green where many events will be taking place, free concerts etc! Hope this helps add to your fun:-)   P.S. Staying longer than one day/night is perfectly fine. Just let me know!	29.759744343671304	-95.36898274949459	Beautiful midtown/Downtown apt	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17014599?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
