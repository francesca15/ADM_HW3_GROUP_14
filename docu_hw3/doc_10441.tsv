$53	1	Austin	January 2013	A wonderful little retreat right in the middle of Austin. The cabin is only 180 sq ft but has everything you need. Twin bed with 400 thread count sheets, fine towels, coffee &amp; tea setup. While very simple, it is about half the price of a hotel.	30.301065708159104	-97.7403899648695	Tiny Zen Cabin in Heart of Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1024819?location=Brazos%20River%2C%20TX
