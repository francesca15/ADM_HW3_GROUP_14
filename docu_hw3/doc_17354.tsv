$32	1	Frisco	July 2014	I live in a cozy single story house with a couple of small outdoor places to sit and drink your coffee in the morning. I am located a couple of miles from a Starbucks, movie theatre, dining, grocery store, two freeways and more. The room is great for a single professional.	33.143901482870305	-96.7708368359219	Safe and Quiet	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18160732?location=Anna%2C%20TX
