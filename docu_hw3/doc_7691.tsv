$125	1	Austin	March 2016	Designed by award-winning modernist architecture firm Alterstudio, this Corbusier-inspired getaway in the heart of Austin's rolling hills looks and feels like nothing else in the area. The home is nestled in seclusion at the rear of a fully-wooded 5-acre lot. The guest house is on a detached portion of the home giving you the privacy you are looking for and deserve. Backed up to the natural forestry of Austin, you can wade in the underground pool and sip on complementary spirits and teas.	30.330444487947197	-97.8638101804805	Tranquil Hill Country Retreat &Pool	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18110793?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
