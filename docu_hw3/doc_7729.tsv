$100	2	McKinney	December 2010	Â¡Mi casa es su casa! This cozy and colorful 2 bedroom/1 bathroom is perfect for an overnight oasis or weekend getaway. This is my primary home, but I often hit the road on weekends and fill my summers with travel. There is nothing better than finding that charming 'home away from home' and I hope my 'casita' can be that for you!	33.210383330732896	-96.62366860463409	Colorful Casita	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16795494?location=Celina%2C%20TX
