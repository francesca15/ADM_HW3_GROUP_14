$70	1	Amarillo	May 2014	My place is right off the highway and 3 minutes from downtown or 2 minutes from plenty of restaurants &amp; bars in the area. Youâ€™ll love my place because my tiny house is cozy, clean and comfortable with all the amenities you'll need to enjoy a night in Amarillo. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).	35.193924764075604	-101.853148615333	Midcentury Modern Tiny House Close to Everything	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16393858?location=Amarillo%2C%20TX
