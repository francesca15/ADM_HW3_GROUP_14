$86	Studio	Corpus Christi	February 2015	This unit is located downtown in the Nueces Lofts. It's a clean flat with a full sized bed, futon, and walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, bars and the beach (exactly 1 mile from Mcgee Beach). This is my second listing and this place is airb&amp;b only, noone lives here. The unit has some cooking utensils (not for a huge dinner) and a coffee maker. We do supply a few coffee pods and coffee, but you may prefer your own.	27.796478119039303	-97.39322841698392	DOWNTOWN LOFT NEAR BAYFRONT	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9364046?location=Corpus%20Christi%2C%20TX
