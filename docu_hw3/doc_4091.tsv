$66	2	San Antonio	February 2014	Our home is filled with warmth from lots of natural light. The original wood floors and earthy decor create a peaceful environment for anyone. We have a big backyard &amp; garden that is very kid and pet friendly as well as many toys to share in our boys room. The house is 5 minutes away from the airport as well as 10 minutes away from downtown. We are in the middle of San Antonio which is a great location for accessing all types of fun.	29.510002996906	-98.4718480045564	Peaceful home near airport & downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19014109?location=Converse%2C%20TX
