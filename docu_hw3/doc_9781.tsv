$50	Studio	Lakehills	April 2017	This house is only a minute drive from the lake and is a perfect place to bring friends and family. There is a lot of land where you can BBQ, sit outside, eat, and have a picnic with a great view of the lake. If you get tired of being outdoors, you can go inside and either cook there or just hang out and watch TV. There is a Blu-Ray &amp; DVD player so feel free to bring your favorite movies!	29.561940728668798	-98.9600750614095	The Woodsy Lake House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18237352?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
