$118	1	Boerne	January 2013	The Sleeping Porch is perched on a elevated two acre hill over looking the hill country along what was once the Old Spanish Trail. A unique experience for those looking for authentic hill country old ranch style experience.. A place for those who love privacy and seclusion amount the sights and sounds of nature. The Sleeping Porch is screened in awesome panoramic view with a nice southerly breeze yet heavy drapes can be closed to allow the AC to cool down the space in a matter of minutes.	29.7947298050494	-98.7316798914205	Sleeping Porch Awesome View	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13408497?location=Boerne%2C%20TX
