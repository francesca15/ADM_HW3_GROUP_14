$215	3	Amarillo	March 2016	We call this home “Big Chief 66”. Firstly, Big Chief because of an old portrait of a chief and other touches of Native American influence which decorate the home. And “66” for Route 66, as the house is virtually surrounded by old (and even new) alignments of the legendary road.	35.214607309875	-101.88763745678499	Big Chief 66 - 3 bed/2 bath	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17648893?location=Amarillo%2C%20TX
