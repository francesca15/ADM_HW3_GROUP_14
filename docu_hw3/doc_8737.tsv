$35	1	San Antonio	May 2016	My place is close to Sea World and Fiesta Texas, Lackland Air Force Base, and the Helotes area. The airport, city center, and medical center are all an easy drive away using local highways. The room is cozy and comfortable with a queen sized bed (extra air mattress available as needed). Guests have their own bathroom just next to the bedroom and can use a shared kitchen, office, and laundry room. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	29.5254885606531	-98.7263881639925	Alamo Ranch/Sea World Area Room in San Antonio	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13166279?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
