$90	1	Dallas	June 2013	Stay in the master suite which was recently built and is organically cleaned, no scents or perfumes. Coffee and teas are provided if we are home. There's also a Keurig in the kitchen.  We're a vegan family of 4, soon to be 5.  We get up early for school and try to be as quiet as possible. Most of the time we get back home around 5.  Feel free to come out, cook, there's room for you in the fridge, watch TV (I have no clue how to work it, my first TV in 15 years)	32.9078020547392	-96.8607243488381	Organic Contemporary Master Bedroom	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7781194?location=Addison%2C%20TX
