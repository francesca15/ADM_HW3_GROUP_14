$59	2	San Antonio	June 2014	Cute hideaway cottage only 1 mile from the Pearl District. Nestled between Government Hill and Dignowity Hill historic districts, our little Tex-mex casita is just a 15 minute walk to the Pearl or Dignowity Hill beer gardens, and only 2 miles from the Alamo! You get the privacy of an entire house, but at the price of a room- perfect for artsy budget travelers.
