$145	1	Fort Worth	April 2013	You've found our Bungalow Haven in Fort Worth. The detached ground floor guest house is located virtually on The Texas Christian University campus - in fact closer to most of the academic buildings and performance venues than many of the dorms. Seldom will you find an accommodation away from home that offers so many amenities for a one-night or month-long stay. Our cozy getaway is ideal for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families with kids (children or the grown up kind!).	32.7128212684586	-97.36150149326009	Texas Bungalow Haven	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9741690?location=Burleson%2C%20TX
