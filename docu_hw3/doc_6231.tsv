$575	4	New Braunfels	December 2014	Adorable river cottage with rustic touches.   Each summer we have been completely booked! Be sure to book early to be able to stay at this great property!  The water is yours! We are waterfront, a short walk from the house, down to the water and hop in and play!   We are on Lake Dunlap, which is part of the Guadalupe river that widens and is designated as a lake after it crosses I-35. Boats and jetski's are allowed. Quiet, serene, a great place to decompress and relax away from all the crowds.	29.667303004886197	-98.06921653007429	2 Story Lake Dunlap Haus~Waterfront & Private!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17805105?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
