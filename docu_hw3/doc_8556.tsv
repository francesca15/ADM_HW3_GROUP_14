$95	1	Cedar Park	July 2015	The Green Tea Room is quite lovely. It has a king sized bed. It is very comfortable. I have a Wall mounted TV. The room is located on the lower level of my home. The bathroom is private and not shared with any other guests. No pets or smoking is ever permitted. A huge country style breakfast is served each morning so guests can really Fuel up before exploring the greater Austin area.	30.529432371771303	-97.82453381055099	The Green Tea Room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18877755?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
