$35	1	McKinney	January 2017	My place is close to many restaurants and retail stores Target (3 min), Walmart (5 min), etc. Close to highway 75 and SRT 121, providing quick access to highways.  Youâ€™ll love my place because of how spacious and clean it is. The second floor is entirely for guests, ensuring near full privacy. If more space is needed (extra bedrooms or couches), then please be sure to inquire! We can work out a deal. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	33.2266004298057	-96.6415563455685	Gorgeous Spacious Home w/ Private Bedroom 1A	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16959424?location=Allen%2C%20TX
