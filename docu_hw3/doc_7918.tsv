$189	3	Carrollton	March 2016	My place is a new house build in 2015 and is close to all major highways ( PGBT, 121, DNT, 635), Restaurants, shopping, entertainment. This home is perfect for an extended stay with three comfortable bedrooms, a office space, wifi, and plenty of empty closets for storing luggage, clothing, etc. My place is good for couples, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.  As a welcome gesture, I stock up the fridge with Milk, Bread and Eggs on the day of the check in.	33.0365659031131	-96.86227016548919	Home Away from Home - Perfect Location	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14993696?location=Carrollton%2C%20TX
