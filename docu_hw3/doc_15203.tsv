$300	3	Kemah	March 2016	My place is minutes away from Kemah Boardwalk, NASA, Clear Lake and Galveston Island is a short, 20 minute drive away.   The 3 bedroom, 2 bath house has an open floor plan and fully fenced yard. Youâ€™ll love my place because it is located one block away from the water and has an amazing porch to enjoy the coastal breeze on. Great for families, couples, solo adventurers, and groups. Marina Del Sol is located behind the house if you wish to dock your boat overnight for a fee.	29.5495632744876	-95.05244445612949	Lake Living in Kemah	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14395852?location=Bacliff%2C%20TX
