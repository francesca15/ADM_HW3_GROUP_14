$325	3	Kingsland	May 2017	Designer owned and decorated water front cottage. In a secluded quiet area of Kingsland, but one minute from grocery store and coffee shop. This home has become a favorite for travelors because of it's charm and custom details like pillow top mattresses, farm house table, as well as the water toys (kayaks and paddle boat) that come with the house. Boat launch is near and if you don't have a boat there is a boat rental company that will rent one to you and have it in the water ready for you.	30.6600154328126	-98.4443554326862	Waterfront Cottage Turtle Rock Lake House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18828994?location=Buchanan%20Dam%2C%20TX
