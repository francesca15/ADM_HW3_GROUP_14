$75	1	Waxahachie	June 2016	My place is located in the countryside, but very close to historic downtown square with shopping, restaurants, family-friendly activities and also a pretty painless 20-25 minute commute to Downtown Dallas. Reconnect with some things you might not have experienced in many years such as the sounds of passing trains, wild flowers, lightning bugs, and mooing cows.	32.3793209250615	-96.8606278683669	Historic Victorian Farmhouse in Waxahachie	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13358153?location=Corsicana%2C%20TX
