$165	2	Fredericksburg	May 2011	This sweet German home is located on a bustling thorough fair to main street Fredericksburg. It is quaint and cozy. It makes one feel that they have stepped back in time to the simple life. It is hard to believe that Rita raised her 5 children here in this small 900 square foot home!	30.274153598835397	-98.8822121852887	Rita's Place, in town FBG, Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4827638?location=Brazos%20River%2C%20TX
