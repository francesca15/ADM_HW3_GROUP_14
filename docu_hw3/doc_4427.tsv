$350	4	New Braunfels	January 2017	Beautiful, luxury home in the heart of New Braunfels! Close to downtown, Schlitterbahn, rivers, and local amenities. Enjoy the view and a glass of wine or cup of coffee from the deck or upper balcony! Plenty of room for the whole family. Nestled in the trees and feels like you're in the hill country but convenient to town. Twenty minute drive to San Antonio, and 45 minute drive to Austin.	29.6993656674812	-98.1546027315696	Haus on the hill with amazing views	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17762909?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
