$50	1	Cedar Park	July 2014	Cedar park is just 25 minutes north of downtown Austin &amp; 10-15 minutes from the Domain. Great restaurants &amp; shopping minutes from the house.   Access to the kitchen &amp; your own private bath. Parking included. Great place to escape all the noise &amp; traffic that downtown has but yet still a short drive to several spots.   Recently engaged couple hoping to meet travelers from all over! We are always down for a fun time, but obviously have full time jobs &amp; ask that you respect that   Book now!	30.498566413825802	-97.83912032509409	Spacious home outside ACL	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19230036?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
