$65	Studio	Fort Worth	May 2015	Enjoy your stay in this cute cozy studio on the 4th floor, within walking distance to Sundance Square and all things offered in the downtown area like shopping, restaurants, Starbucks, and convention center. Right on the Trinity River, so perfect for walking or running on the river trails. **My cat (Penelope) will be there** during the summer months so you must be ok with this. She's 13 and sleeps a lot, so she won't bother you. You don't need to take care of her, she will just be there.	32.7616445472665	-97.3286811493656	Downtown large studio apartment	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11837656?location=Azle%2C%20TX
