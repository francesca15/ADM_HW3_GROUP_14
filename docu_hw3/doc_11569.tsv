$89	1	Dallas	August 2012	My place is close to the popular dining and shopping district of Knox/Henderson. Knox Street restaurants and bars (including Starbucks &amp; a trader joes) are just 3 blocks north. My condo is centrally located: $10 uber from Love Field airport, 1 mile to uptown area, and 2.5 miles to downtown. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness yet open feeling, the location, and the high ceilings. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.	32.819365606117	-96.7935053110202	Knox Condo on Katy Trail	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13858418?location=Brazos%20River%2C%20TX
