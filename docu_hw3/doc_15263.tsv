$34	1	Dallas	June 2012	My place is close to The Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens, and White Rock Lake. It only takes 14 minutes to get to Downtown Dallas/Fair Park. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, access to fully loaded kitchen, comfy queen size bed, and quick highway access. Dallas is a city that you need a car. There is plenty of free parking in front of my house. I have another room in this house that I have been Airbnbing since May 2016	32.8088230867937	-96.6789522700845	14 minutes to Downtown/Fair Park!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15708430?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
