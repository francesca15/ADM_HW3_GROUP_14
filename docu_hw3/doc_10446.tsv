$20	1	Round Rock	June 2017	Hi, This is a clean, quiet, comfortable room, You'll enjoy your stay here!  There is a light on the ceiling with the ceiling fan, and a lamp next to the bed. You'll find my home quiet and comfortable. I have a maltipoo who is getting older and may have an accident once in a while - but not in your room - it's rare. She is super sweet, rarely barks and loves people.	30.553171323044896	-97.75365839567591	Calm, quiet, single-person room in Round Rock!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19437081?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
