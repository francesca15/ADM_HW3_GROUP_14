$297	3	Llano	January 2017	Our B&amp;B is close to the Llano River, with great views, and only 1.75 miles from town. Our place is defined by the country setting, Star Gazing Pavillion and our miniature donkeys! Our B &amp;B is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups. If you want peace and solitude you can find it here! You especially want to visit us during the wildflower season because the photographic opportunities are unbelievable.	30.7509407280042	-98.70267540199092	Circle Your Wagons Bed and Breakfast	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16634092?location=Brady%2C%20TX
