$54	1	Irving	May 2016	My place is less than 10-15 minutes from both major airports. It's also in Las Colinas, about 10 minutes from top-notch restaurants and country clubs and other venues. Youâ€™ll love my place because it's a brand new home, the bed is comfy, the living room is cozy, and the kitchen is user-friendly. My place is good for solo adventurers and business travelers.	32.8599914820537	-96.98138480761341	New Home in Las Colinas near Both Airports	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13277869?location=Colleyville%2C%20TX
