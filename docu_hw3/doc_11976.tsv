$200	2	South Padre Island	February 2017	Wake up to a beautiful sunrise with birds chirping in this tropical paradise.

Friendly atmosphere, walking distance to restaurants, shopping centers, grocery stores and night clubs. Great for families. There is a coin operated laundromat onsite. BBQ grilling is allowed away from the building. Entertainment is just steps away, this place is sure to make vacation memorable.	26.1021607569496	-97.162852218667	LP 110 2bd 1 bath Oceanfront condo sleeps 6	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17876544?location=Brownsville%2C%20TX
