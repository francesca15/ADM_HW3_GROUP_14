$85	Studio	Kemah	March 2015	This is best for one person or two people sleeping separate as the beds are singles. A fun antique store is close by, as well as good food- such as Skipper's and Joe's. All in all, a walkable area. The Johnson Space Center and the Space Center Houston Visitor's Center are about 15-20 minutes away, either way around Clear Lake.	29.5415853615836	-95.0375975672325	33' of Freedom Sailboat	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18581948?location=Beach%20City%2C%20TX
