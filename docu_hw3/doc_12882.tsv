$300	2	Bryan	June 2017	We are located only 15 minutes (6 miles) out of town which is just far enough to enjoy the quiet countryside atmosphere yet still be close enough for quick trips into town. We are centrally located so University Dr., Hwy 30 or Briarcrest Dr. are all three easily accessible. The university is only 15-20 minutes away, depending on traffic conditions. Our home is in a quiet neighborhood with spacious surroundings which gives a private getaway ambience.	30.6885986280263	-96.27325827704071	Quiet getaway w/pool only 15 minutes from town	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19100037?location=Bryan%2C%20TX
