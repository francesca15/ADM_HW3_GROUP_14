$31	1	Dallas	February 2014	Our home is located in Funky Little Forest Hills. We are near the arboretum and White Rock Lake. You can feel the artsy vibe of the 'hood as soon as you pull onto one of our streets!   You will love walking (or driving!) up and down the streets and looking at houses and yards. It really is a special place to live and visit!   Your room is clean with dark curtains to block light for better rest. There is no door on the room currently- please know this upfront. The room is priced accordingly.	32.8200192048971	-96.69960381706458	Lotus room in Zen house	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19400339?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
