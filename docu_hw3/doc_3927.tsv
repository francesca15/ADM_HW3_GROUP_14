$95	1	Austin	March 2013	Nestled in the very back of our backyard amid the cacti and bamboo, this sun-filled 1 bdrm, 1 bath cottage comfortably fits two. Enjoy spitting-distance access to UT, downtown Austin, I-35 and the MetroRail, as well as the restaurants, coffee shops, food trailers and parks of the eclectic Eastside Cherrywood neighborhood. Or just laze about on our hammock.   It's accessible through our driveway or a gate on the other side of our yard, giving you complete privacy to you come and go as you like. The queen-sized Murphy bed folds up to give even more space. Other features include a lots of window space with blinds, a large desk/table, 24/7 WIFI access, and a mini-fridge, microwave and coffeemaker. And of course, AC (as well as heat for the one week of the year it's cold here).  We're located in the tree-lined French Place section of Austin's eclectic Cherrywood neighborhood, near campus and very central. Downtown is only a few minutes away by car, bus or train. You'll have an easy two-block walk to assorted coffee shops, groceries, liquor stores, taco joints and food trailers, as well as a fair share of well-reviewed restaurants. You can hop-skip to the bus or drive in under five minutes to the nearest MetroRail station (a must during SXSW or ACL, when parking downtown is impossible).   We'll work with you on check in-and-out times. Our two large cats will work with you on any feline needs. (Though they're not allowed in the space, so if you're allergic, don't worry.)  Parking is a breeze on the street with no restrictions or permits required.
