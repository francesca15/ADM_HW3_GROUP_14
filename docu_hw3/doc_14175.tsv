$118	2	Amarillo	February 2016	My place is close to restaurants and dining, shopping, the hospital (if one of your loved ones is staying there), and more. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the comfy bed, the coziness, and the kitchen. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). It will sleep up to four people (in two queen-size beds).	35.1731747821299	-101.873850666796	Home Away from Home on Paramount	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15640106?location=Amarillo%2C%20TX
