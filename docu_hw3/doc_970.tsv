$30	1	Austin	April 2017	This is a peaceful, quiet place in Southwest Austin. It's surrounded by excellent restaurants and shopping, 15 minutes from South Congress and downtown.   It's the perfect place for dogs, with a big grassy area and miles of walking trails right behind the building. The pool area is always clean and quiet.  The inside is simple, clean and comfortable with great natural light. The living room is cozy with free Wifi and access to Xbox and Netflix.    I'd love for you to stay here!	30.212416559857804	-97.81700026405649	Peaceful, Private Condo in Southwest Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18528747?location=Austin%2C%20TX
