$115	1	Manchaca	August 2011	A stone throw south of the Austin City Limits, this cabin is situated in 2.5 wooded acres. Luxurious and quiet. It is inhabited by deer, raccoon, rabbits, owls, lizards and butterflies. There is an old stone well filled by an aquifer (legend states the well was built by Ben McCullough; the civil war hero). A large back yard is used for walks, bonfires and golfing/batting balls. Lounge in the dappled sun on the patio near a running pond surrounded with gardens. Prepare a leisurely bar-b-que. Talk late into the night by the fire pit.   This 100+ yr old cabin has been revived and furnished with love. Time seems to stop while soaking in the deep old claw tub filled with endless hot spring water . Drifting to sleep, become aware of crackling in the wood burning stove, a train whistle and the trickling pond. Breakfast choices are street tacos or waffles...with pecans?   Its possible you'll be tempted to stay all day. However, the center of Austin or San Marcos, with music, swimming, fishing and kayaking are just 15-25 minutes from this retreat.  Sound like a fit for you? More info: Circuit of the Americas is 18 miles through country roads. It is possible to attend this event and never enter Austin. A toll road will deliver you from the airport to the cabin and the event without the Austin traffic. Also close and south is an after race restaurant popular with race participants.   Note for SXSW and other major events: Consider being in the crowds day and night then retreating by the fire at your quiet abode just 15 minutes south from all the ruckus of Central Austin.

WEDDING PACKAGE: Evening before and night of wedding. This facilitates hosting out of town guests the night before and the day of. (note weekends are a two night minimum. this generally is not practical for the newly weds.) However, the events prior to the big event serves as an informal staging area and a place for your guests who need a meet up, changing and rest area prior to the wedding. Before the bride and groom return from the wedding, host will tidy the cabin and light a fire and candles for their special arrival.  I interact with guests as much as they want. Usually, an initial orientation to the cabin and grounds, then texting for the morning \	30.137385441317896	-97.8278018294535	BREATHE DEEPLY A Cozy Austin Cabin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/728502?location=Colorado%20River%2C%20TX
