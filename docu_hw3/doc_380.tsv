$235	1	South Padre Island	February 2017	Wake up to a beautiful sunrise with birds chirping in this tropical paradise. Go for a refreshing swim in the crystal blue pool or sit under the shady pallapas to enjoy a refreshing drink. Friendly atmosphere, walking distance to restaurants, shopping centers, grocery stores and night clubs. Great for families. There is a coin operated laundromat onsite. BBQ grilling is allowed away from the building. Entertainment is just steps away, this place is sure to make vacation memorable.	26.101137649975602	-97.1634074013803	LP 201 Oceanfront 1bd 1ba sleeps 5	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17846087?location=Brownsville%2C%20TX
