$150	1	Houston	March 2017	Hi! My name is Mitchell and welcome to my place! I recently moved into an amazing luxury apartment complex called Village on The Lake. Itâ€™s located directly next to the Johnson Space Center and right on the waterfront with many things to do around the area. With 801 square feet of space, it provides a full living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and 2 patios looking over 1 of the 3 pools as well as the putting greens. It also comes with in-unit washer and dryer and gym access.	29.5632603220886	-95.07844907898581	Lovely Villa-style apt. next to NASA Space Center	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18042096?location=Clear%20Lake%20Shores%2C%20TX
