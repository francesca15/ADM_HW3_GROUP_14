$120	2	Denton	February 2014	Our home is a charming 1930's style Tudor home with eclectic, warm decor. We two blocks from TWU, a short walk to several great restaurants, a grocery store, yoga studios, and the park. We are also a nice 20 minute walk from the downtown square that is filled with shopping, eating, and nightlife. Unfortunately, our home is not for anyone with severe pet allergies as we have two sweet pups.	33.2214549350593	-97.13225376744221	Cozy Home Close to the Square	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15025778?location=Corinth%2C%20TX
