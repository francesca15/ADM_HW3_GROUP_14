$37	1	Beaumont	April 2013	My place is centrally located near restaurants and dining, bars, the highway, and grocery stores. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, the location, and the cute dog that lives here. There is a large backyard with a nice, covered deck. The house is in a quiet neighborhood without much traffic. My place is good for business travelers and people with dogs.	30.0825976720532	-94.1409160682325	Spacious Home in the Heart of Beaumont	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14882102?location=Beaumont%2C%20TX
