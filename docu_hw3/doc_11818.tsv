$100	2	College Station	August 2016	My place is centrally located and a 6-10 minute drive from anything in College Station, including Texas A&amp;M! I do not have any roommates and will not be staying at the location during your stay; therefore, you will have the place to yourself! My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). There is plenty of room for sleeping accommodations for extra guests - just ask! The unit is an upstairs unit in a fourplex. No smoking, parties, or pets.	30.587145869281603	-96.31245488242331	Entire Apartment Nearby Campus - Quiet & Clean	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14686590?location=Bryan%2C%20TX
