$249	3	Fort Worth	June 2016	My place is close to family-friendly activities, great restaurants, and Benbrook Lake. Just outside the busy city, and a short drive to the Fort Worth Stockyards, downtown Fort Worth, and the 7th Street areas. Youâ€™ll love my private swimming pool and neighborhood park. Modern, organized, and clean. This place easily accommodates families with kids or groups of adults because it was designed with an open concept living and kitchen. Anything you might need, I probably have it available for you!	32.677213945184604	-97.4913141238996	Summer Getaway with pool & view	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13671755?location=Cleburne%2C%20TX
