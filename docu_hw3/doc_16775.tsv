$70	1	Corpus Christi	October 2016	Enjoy this newly converted detached garage as a 1 bed / 1 bath guest house. This cozy casita is located in the heart (biri biri bom bom, for you Selana fans) of Corpus Christi where you will be only 2 miles away from the bay. Corpus Christi has some wonderful places to dine but if you prefer to exercise those culinary skills this home has a full kitchenette. This spot is perfect for a couple getting away for the weekend, a solo adventurist, or if you are traveling on business.	27.7346862954102	-97.39505383031229	Cozy Casita	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18854952?location=Aransas%20Pass%2C%20TX
