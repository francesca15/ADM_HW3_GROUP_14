$30	Studio	Denton	October 2014	This is nothing fancy. Simply a place to lay your head for the night. No bathroom, no shower, no sink, but the van does have a camp stove you are welcome to use. This is a work in progress. Please stay at your own risk. As the name implies it is really just a warm place to lay your head for the night. Not great, but better than a manger :)	33.2198928886622	-97.0981645629027	Better than a manger, but not much.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16959627?location=Argyle%2C%20TX
