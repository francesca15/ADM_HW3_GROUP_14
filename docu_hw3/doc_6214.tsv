$165	1	Livingston	March 2012	Ready for peace and quiet? Come sit on the large covered dock with a fishing pole or a good book. Or rock your cares away as you view the beautiful sunset on the lake from the front or back deck.   Cozy waterfront Cottage nestled in Big Thicket just outside Ace, Tx. approx. 50 miles north of Houston.    Our cottage is small and cozy ; sleeps 4 and is enjoyed most by couples wanting a quiet, private, relaxing get a way from the city. It is fully stocked with everything you should need except food, clothes and yourself! The small, private lake offers great bass fishing and we have a small trolling boat and a paddle boat . The trinity river runs nearby and offers a lot of wildlife to watch . There is a birdwatchers trail down the road and in nearby Livingston, Tx, there is numerous antique shops and restaurants. Florida's Kitchen is a must, as is the old fashion down town movie house.     The cottage is on a peninsula and the views of the sunset over the water from the front and the sunset on the back huge, covered dock is just awesome and to be enjoyed with that glass of wine! We would love to have you come and enjoy!	30.517343978199	-94.8520971089682	Cozy Getaway Lakefront Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/369745?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
