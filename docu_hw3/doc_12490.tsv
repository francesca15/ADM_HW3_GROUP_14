$165	1	Boerne	March 2017	Youâ€™ll love the location because it has a country feel yet is in the middle of town. Depot Cottage was built in 2016 and is located on 3 private acres. The street used to be named Depot Street , site of the Old Boerne Train Station; thus the name, Depot Cottage. Whitetail and Axis deer live on the adjacent properties. Take the Old Depot trail and go East to the Cibolo Creek and feed the ducks or walk West and go have a Bumdoodlers pie! It is a five minute walk to great shopping and food!	29.7955369478661	-98.72020805603609	Depot Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17285081?location=Boerne%2C%20TX
