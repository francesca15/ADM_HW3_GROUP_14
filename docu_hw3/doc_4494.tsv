$87	1	Katy	March 2017	Located only 25 minutes outside of Houston, our place provides convenience by being next to the highway but seclusion from the city. The apartment is open concept with natural lighting. There is a beautiful salt pool with grills and televisions. The courtyard is very peaceful and also includes grills and a dining area. An additional bonus is the lake you can walk adjacent to the apartment.	29.780387652536	-95.78205450610399	Modern 1 bedroom Apartment	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19473667?location=Cinco%20Ranch%2C%20TX
