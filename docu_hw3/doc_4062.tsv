$500	3	College Station	August 2015	This home is the perfect place to stay when you visit Aggieland. It has an open floor plan, a great kitchen/dining area and a living room with a gas fireplace. The back yard has a large back patio and bar area perfect for enjoying Texas evenings.  Two of the bedrooms have extremely comfortable queen beds and in a third bedroom, used as an office, I will set up a queen air mattress if needed.
