$42	1	Houston	August 2016	My place is close to everything. It is on a very quiet street between two major streets. The famous Galleria Shopping Mall is just down the street. It's a great location. Youâ€™ll love my home because of the coziness and very comfortable. It is good for business traveler, couples, solo adventurers, and a parent and child.	29.7429161308071	-95.4840774445027	Comfortable townhome in convenient location	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14809155?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
