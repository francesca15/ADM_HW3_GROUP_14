$39	2	Spring Branch	February 2016	Our cozy house is a getaway from the big city. Minutes from the Guadalupe River, enjoy evenings by the fire pit under the oaks with a glass of wine or a cold beer. In the morning, have coffee on the deck, watching the deer and listening to the birds. Two guest rooms and a private bathroom are available with one queen bed and one twin air mattress. We are located about 45 minutes from New Braunfels, San Antonio, Boerne and Fredericksburg, making this a great hub for exploring the Hill Country.	29.8530860170506	-98.4567998192338	Ranch Charm in Texas Hill Country	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13347133?location=Bulverde%2C%20TX
