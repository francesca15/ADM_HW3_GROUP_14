$82	3	Palacios	February 2017	My place is close to Fishing and Hunting. Oyster Lake is a great place to fish.  Great place to stay for STP workers. This location is about 28 miles south of Bay City, Texas. Nearest town is Palacios which is about 15 minutes away. Bay City has Walmart and HEB. Palacios has a Lowes grocery store and a few restaurants.  I will have more photos as we are still working on d√©cor and furnishings. I do have Horses living on this property. I will stop by in evening to feed. Petting horses are ok.	28.732626161078898	-96.1405346461596	Blue Oyster House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17283114?location=Bay%20City%2C%20TX
