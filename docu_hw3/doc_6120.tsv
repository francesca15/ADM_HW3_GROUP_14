$45	1	Frisco	January 2016	Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). It's close to family friendly activities as well as restaurants and dining. You will also have your own private bath with a king size bed. The space is ideal for one person for longer term stays. For stays longer than 90 days, we can negotiate a great rate for a longer term stay. Need a separate room for your teen or a single? I have another room with a twin bed available for a small additional fee.	33.1326727733004	-96.7729539415864	Beautiful 2-Story Home w/Private Bath	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13545463?location=Celina%2C%20TX
