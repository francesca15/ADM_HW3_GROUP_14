$300	4	Goodrich	October 2016	The house is located on the historic Trinity River about 1 hour north of Houston, Texas. Youâ€™ll love my place because of its waterfront access to the river and the many opportunites for fishing, swimming, kayaking, hiking, and birdwatching. The 2 BR river house is brand new and the nearby 2 BR cabin is a great rustic home for kids or fellow travelers. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).  House or cabin can be rented individually.	30.557669578663603	-94.8888800847398	Waterfront Trinity River Estate and Cabin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16175782?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
