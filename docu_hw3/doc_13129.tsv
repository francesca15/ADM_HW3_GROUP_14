$50	1	Dallas	June 2012	My home is located in the heart of Lower Greenville and walking distance to Henderson Avenue. Some of Dallas’ best restaurants are close by including bars and shops for you to explore in the neighborhood. There are grocery stores within walking distance including Sprouts and Trader Joe’s. Yoga centers, crossfit, coffee shops and a bakery are also in the neighborhood. Getting to Uptown or Deep Ellum is a breeze with the Uber or Lyft app and is roughly about $6 each way or the bus is blocks away.	32.8137995375737	-96.7723892652808	Lower Greenville Private Suite	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14331045?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
