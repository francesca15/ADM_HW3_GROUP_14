$40	1	Temple	May 2015	You're going to love it here! The neighborhood is quiet, your room is quiet, and you will have your own bathroom. Every morning you can have fresh coffee, homemade goodies and fresh fruit. I'm only 5 minutes from Scott &amp;White. And less than 5 minutes from I-35.	31.0654926148702	-97.38568200561329	A Great Place To Stay!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15375487?location=Belton%2C%20TX
