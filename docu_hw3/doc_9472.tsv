$33	1	Austin	March 2016	When I pull up to my place it feels like I am engulfed by nature with canopied trees, ferns, blooms. I feel tree hugged and protected. I decorate original/home made. My neighborhood is safe and next to a park for walks.	30.1816328545255	-97.80112243058649	Serene space	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11719946?location=Buda%2C%20TX
