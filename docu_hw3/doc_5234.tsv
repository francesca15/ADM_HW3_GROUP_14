$75	1	Dallas	November 2010	A nice, cosy English-styled cottage house that's a 12 minute walk from the Bishop Arts District which is filled with local restaurants, boutique shops, and the streetcar line. I have two bikes available, which means you're minutes from the historic Texas Theatre, the Kessler Theatre, and the Roger Lytle disc golf course (I have frisbees available in the laundry room). I'm a musician, so the house is filled with an assortment of guitars, ukuleles, accordions, pianos, and violins.	32.7578901670536	-96.83018882637909	Cozy cottage home near Bishop Arts	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16554106?location=Cedar%20Hill%2C%20TX
