$60	1	San Antonio	December 2014	Seriously. This is a nice corner bedroom. Plenty of natural night. Unless you're a vampire, then there are blinds for that. Or a nice big closet to hide in. Not to mention the dedicated guest bathroom just across the hall. Either way is fine with me.	29.5000830837747	-98.45067037001151	It's a room, in a house!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6045426?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
