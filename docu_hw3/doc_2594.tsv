$50	1	Pflugerville	December 2016	Hello, my name is Alma. I am a school counselor and enjoy hosting friendly people from most walks of life. I live alone in a modern 3 bedroom 2 bath manufactured home located in a quiet and safe community north of Austin about 15 minutes from downtown area. I have two private bedrooms available with access to a full bathroom. One room comes with TV and a queen size bed and the other with a large futon and small desk work area. I am happy to host but respect your privacy first and foremost.	30.414044564704398	-97.6048281860853	North Austin Home w/ Private Room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16230486?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
