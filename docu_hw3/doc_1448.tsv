$25	1	Converse	March 2017	I am retired military looking to meet new folks and share part of my home. My space is great for solo adventurers, and business travelers. The location is only 15 minutes from beautiful Downtown San Antonio/River Walk. Enjoy your time in a private bed room and bath. Please be aware that I have one small dog, but she will not disturb you during your stay :) I look forward to meeting you!	29.4669848248302	-98.32244933900499	J and S Casa 2	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18152740?location=Converse%2C%20TX
