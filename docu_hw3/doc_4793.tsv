$122	3	Austin	April 2012	If you're looking to experience what Austin is about, this is it. Our house was recently remodeled and has a large yard and covered patio for relaxing. It's only a 10 minute walk to Metrorail that goes directly into downtown Austin or a 15 minute drive into downtown. Very close to a lot of the new local restaurants and pubs.	30.3385381183781	-97.7100537067209	The Cinderella Chicken Coop	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5285796?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
