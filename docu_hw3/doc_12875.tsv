$129	Studio	Marble Falls	May 2016	This unique &amp; amazing place is good for couples and solo adventurers. You'll take a hike down the hill to the authentic American Indian Tee Pee. Altho short, the hike is on a rough and steep terrain, and does have some steps on the steepest areas. Be sure to wear some good hiking shoes and be aware that you should be fairly fit to traverse it several times during your stay.	30.548017197666102	-98.12896110825581	Sunrise Ti Pi on the lake	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17262885?location=Burnet%2C%20TX
