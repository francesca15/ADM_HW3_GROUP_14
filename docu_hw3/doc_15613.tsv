$180	3	Euless	June 2017	In the heart of D/FW and next to Grapevine, this is a great place to stay if you want convenience. Located just 5 minutes west of the airport &amp; less than 5 minutes from Grapevine, we are close to Dallas, Fort Worth, &amp; all cities in-between. There is so much to do: shopping, restaurants, movies, the lake, hiking trails, water parks, Six Flags, etc. In our home there are 4 bedrooms (one is empty if you need a place for an air mattress) &amp; 2 baths. It is SAFE, LOVELY &amp; well cared for. See you soon!	32.874685534117	-97.0885727920561	Beautiful Home, Just Minutes From D/FW Airport	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19246600?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
