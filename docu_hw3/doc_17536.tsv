$68	1	Denton	April 2015	My place is nicely situated between UNT, TWU, and downtown Denton, all are walkable. It is a charming 2br/2ba house, with a style that I call contemporary cabin because of all the wood. While you are here you will have use of the front bedroom and guest bath. You are also welcome to use the living room, kitchen, and front and back porches as you wish. The bed in the available bedroom is actually two twins. They can be pushed together or separated, whichever suits you.	33.2210862373131	-97.14102656265	Charming house, close to everything Denton	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6332100?location=Argyle%2C%20TX
