$30	1	Manchaca	May 2012	These accommodations are in a nice 2014 large single-wide mobile home about 10 miles south of downtown near I-35. The area is called Manchaca. There is lots of greenery around, a ranch down the street and a very authentic, folksy Texas Bar B Q place across the street.	30.1415093891488	-97.8269366566823	Village Community	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4308274?location=Buda%2C%20TX
