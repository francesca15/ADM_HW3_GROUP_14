$387	1	Granbury	April 2016	The Pool House is a private 700 sq foot house with a bedroom/king bed, a galley kitchen with full size refrigerator, living room, and large bathroom with double vanities and a large glassed in shower. The Pool House is a short walk to downtown Granbury for shopping, dining and entertainment.
