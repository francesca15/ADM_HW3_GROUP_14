$800	3	Austin	November 2013	This beautifull 3bdr, 2bth house with driveway and backyard is perfect for the F1 weekend. The house is occupied by a family year round, so you can expect the place to be very clean and everything in perfect working condition. We are a smoke free house and we have a small dog, so small pets will be welcome. There is also a two car garage and a driveway that could park 4 cars with no problem. The house is approximately 1 mile from COTA, the shuttle busses from Del Valle High school are within walking distance, or you could take a 20min bike ride to the track, but if you have a parking pass it will take you no longer than 10min to get there. You will also have easy access to the toll roads and to Hwy71, from the house is about a 20min drive to downtown, the airport is only a five minute drive. Last year we sat in our driveway to listen to the cars, yes is that close!!	30.1697843205946	-97.62703181990629	Last minute deal, 1ml from COTA	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1905942?location=Cedar%20Creek%2C%20TX
