Condo is a 3 minute walk to the beach on a wooden boardwalk and is also within walking distance to the grocery store and shopping area. Centrally located in Port Aransas. Reserved parking space for your vehicle.  This is primarily a family oriented property. This is the perfect place to bring your small children and loved ones. You could either spend the entire day at the sandy beach with the ocean waves or you could spend the day poolside with your family with the grill going.    There are several boutiques and restaurants nearby. One of our favorite restaurants is Ragin' Cajun! They dress the table with butcher paper, provide the kiddos with crayons and when the seafood is ready they dump it on the time for everyone to dig in! They provide the bibs and the roll of napkins of course. Most evening they have a one man band that makes the entire place liven up! There are several seafood eateries, mexican as well as pizzerias nearby.   Unfortunately there is no public transportation but most of the locals get around in Fun colorded golf carts. They are great to get around Port Aransas.   I do hope you decide to visit this cute beach town. If there is any questions i may help answer please let me know. I would be more than happy to answer any questions or concerns.	27.8186061929908	-97.0646715391693	1 BDRM CONDO WALKING DIST TO BEACH	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/893772?location=Aransas%20Pass%2C%20TX
