$75	1	Austin	October 2012	The private bedroom is painted in soothing grays, decorated with colorful pictures and has a real Queen bed dressed in bright linens. There is a spacious walk-in closet in the bedroom to hang clothes and an iron and ironing board downstairs by the washer/dryer and all are available for your use.   The private full bathroom is right across the hall and is supplied with shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, shave lotion, and bath linens.  In the mornings, help yourself in the kitchen to coffee and OJ and dive into the basket filled with your choice of fruit, nut butters, preserves, toast, and oatmeal.   While staying with us you will have the good fortune to be the recipients of loving attention from our two lovely lady dogs (a border collie and a chocolate labrador). The girls have never meet a stranger that they didn't love and vice versa!   Our neighborhood boasts a park one block away from the house that has a broad field, play-scales and swings, basketball courts, and many beautiful hike and bike trails in the surrounding greenbelt and nature preserve. The trails are surprising as they are filled with art from 4 different artists. You will see found-object sculptures, fantastical huts, waves, and walls made from dead trees and stones, and hidden messages throughout the woods.  Starbucks is less than a mile straight down the road from us (easily walkable). Within a three mile radius of the house there are several big shopping districts including Central Market (a huge foodie grocery store), a brand new Whole Foods, as well as many dining options. We are happy to wax poetic about the food in Austin and make suggestions about the many awesome dining options!   There is public transit (the 238 bus) at the end of our street and we are the second house on the street-a stone's throw from our door! This bus line travels up South Lamar through the heart of the city providing easy access to the majority of Austin attractions as well as other bus route connections. We will provide maps and info for bus and car to help you get around the city.   Downtown and the river (Lady Bird Lake) is only about 6 miles away. The F1 Track is a short drive or cab ride away from the house.   My husband, Josh, and I love to meet new people and are excited about having you visit Austin!  You have complete privacy in your bedroom and the full bathroom. You may use the laundry, kitchen, and dining room. The master bedroom and bath and pilates equipment is off limits.  We will be present at the listing so you will share the house with my husband and I and our two dogs. We both work full-time and tend to have mornings off but work until late in the evening. When home, we are happy to get to know you and help guide you in your visit of Austin. We are also just as happy to point you in any direction you need and leave you to your own plans.  Our neighborhood is far enough away from the center of the city to be wonderfully quiet and close enough for the convenience of access to the heart of the city!  We have a Capital Metro Bus Line, the 238, which has a stop right at the corner of our block a 30 second walk!	30.1976753585149	-97.8255774957931	Warm & friendly B & B in S.
