$50	1	Richmond	August 2016	My place is close to Historic Richmond and Rosenberg and close easy access to 59.. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood and the comfy bed. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.  Please note that this is an upstairs room with NO DOOR, but it is very private and has its own full bath and air/heat controls. There is a mini refrigerator, a desk and a queen bed. There is room for another queen air mattress that I can supply and a twin air mattress.	29.571748359633897	-95.745662379699	1 Bedroom in Richmond/Rosenberg area close to 59	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14712373?location=Beasley%2C%20TX
