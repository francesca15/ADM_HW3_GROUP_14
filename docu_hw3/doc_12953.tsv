$73	1	San Antonio	February 2015	Fantastic location! Charming bungalow-style home nestled in the heart of San Antonio in Tobin Hill. Being a native of SA I have lived in my home since I was 5 yrs old &amp; have a lot of fond memories and history of the area. The beautiful San Antonio River Walk is just 7 minutes away with a network of walkways to stroll along the banks of the river.   Business travelers are welcome and perfect location for downtown business. Walkable and quite neighborhood and YMCA gym right down the street.	29.4538665428445	-98.4893687354063	Cozy Private Apartment - Near Riverwalk/Downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5497090?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
