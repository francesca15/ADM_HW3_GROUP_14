$30	1	San Antonio	July 2015	I hope youâ€™ll love my place because of the quiet ambiance and easy accessibility to San Antonio. My space is great for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. The location is only 20 minutes from beautiful Downtown San Antonio/River Walk. Enjoy your time in a private bed room and bath. Please be aware that I have one small dog, but he will not disturb you during your stay :) I look forward to meeting you!	29.466840832392897	-98.35398387025499	Quaint Room and Bath	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13641005?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
