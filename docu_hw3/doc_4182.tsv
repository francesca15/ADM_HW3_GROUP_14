$174	3	College Station	October 2016	My place is close to Kyle Field and Texas A&amp;M Campus (10 min drive), and Veteran's Park. Youâ€™ll love it for Aggie game days because nearly all of my neighbors are Aggie alumni families who host out of town guests for tailgates and watch parties. My place is good for couples and families (with kids).	30.6499748385444	-96.28458415858	New 3x2 Townhouse near Texas A&M & Kyle Field!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15313867?location=College%20Station%2C%20TX
