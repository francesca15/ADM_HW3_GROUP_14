$85	1	Glen Rose	January 2017	This home has knotty pine throughout giving a warm woodsy cabin feel. The location is in the heart of town overlooking Barnard St. and backing up to Live Oak for easy access. The charming downtown square is just two blocks away for a nice walk, drive, or bicycle ride for food or shopping. The Big Rock Park is not far also on Barnard. There are several sitting areas inside and out on the covered porch, the courtyard, or under a big shady oak to enjoy the feel of this small hill country town.	32.2387178824195	-97.7546150183568	The Silver Dollar Room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16867255?location=Cleburne%2C%20TX
