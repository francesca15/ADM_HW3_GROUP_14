$179	3	Austin	November 2015	Perfect North Austin retreat. A two minute drive to hop on Interstate 35, 15 minutes to downtown, 10 minutes to The Domain, and 10 minutes to Round Rock Premium Outlets. Excellent location for those wanting a relaxing weekend in a quiet residential neighborhood. Magnificent place for families, business travelers, and guests who have positive reviews. Our home is in a VERY quiet neighborhood and is EXTREMELY clean. We only want guests who also will be quiet and treat our home well.	30.403614365564398	-97.65176433694349	3/2 North Austin Retreat - Hablamos espa√±ol	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18945738?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
