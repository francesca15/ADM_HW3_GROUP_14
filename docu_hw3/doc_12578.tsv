$47	1	Houston	December 2014	My place rocks! Montrose is the best part of town -- I'm near the museums and best bars and restaurants! Lots within walking distance! This is where you want to be!  You have a private bedroom, semi-shared bath in my 3 bed room, 3 story, 2,100 sq.ft. home. Your bed has a memory foam mattress &amp; top notch bedding! Great! I live here alone. You're welcome to share all the common areas, like the dining room and kitchen. I have an awesome cat (who gets awesome reviews), so you must like cats!	29.7340020177791	-95.3896631217053	Townhome in the Heart of Montrose!
