$250	1	Fredericksburg	June 2017	This recently completed cottage has a unique rustic atmosphere we are very excited about. The spacious bedroom, bath, living and kitchen areas give a romantic feel that blends perfect with the outdoor table and chairs for four, BBQ fire ring, and 6-person hot tub. This cottage is one of three that also share an outdoor shower in this gated community. Within 7 miles of Fredericksburg, vineyards, breweries, shopping, and German festivities are abundant.	30.179658443308398	-98.8907929152523	Breezy Hills Cottages - Moonlight Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19473803?location=Center%20Point%2C%20TX
