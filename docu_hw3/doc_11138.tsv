$75	1	Houston	July 2015	As a frequent business traveler myself, I understand needs of business travelers. I have arranged for 24 hour self-check in. This big and beautiful place has everything a business traveler needs - small refrigerator, Eero (super fast Wifi), work desk etc. Even during rush hour, you can go to downtown within 15 min without ever having to get on a freeway. Public transport is also nearby and lot of places to eat /drink. Washington avenue is equivalent to the 6th street of Austin.	29.774147543137	-95.4065959126005	Modern comfort at heart of Houston	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7438602?location=Brazos%20River%2C%20TX
