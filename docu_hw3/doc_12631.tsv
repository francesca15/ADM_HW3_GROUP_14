$40	1	Temple	May 2015	You're going to love it here! The neighborhood is quiet, your room is quiet and you'll have your own bathroom. Each morning you can have fresh coffee, homemade goodies and fresh fruit. I'm 5 minutes from Scott and White. And less than 5 minutes from I-35.	31.0671194830863	-97.3845571704248	An Excellent Place to Stay!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12933386?location=Bell%20County%2C%20TX
