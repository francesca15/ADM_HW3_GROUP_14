$95	Studio	Austin	July 2011	My place is a small, private studio apartment in W. Campus. Youâ€™ll love it because of its central location near lots of amenities: U.T., the Blanton, Pease Park, Fresh Plus Groceries, and many Cap Met bus routes. My place is good for 1-3 travelers.  For those who are looking for newer amenities, my apartment is in an older building. But if, like me, you prefer hardwood floors and a casual environment, then you have found a steal.	30.2912136020938	-97.7496095406181	The greenhole	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17586259?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
