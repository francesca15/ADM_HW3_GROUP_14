$90	Studio	Bee Cave	May 2016	My place is close to Austin Texas. Youâ€™ll love my place because its in the beautiful Hill Country of Austin and off the major traffic paths. Its close to EVERYTHING! You can walk to many amenities. Great shopping entertainment, hikes, and downtown Austin is just 17 minutes away. Our neighborhood is quiet and safe. The guest house has a gorgeous open inviting floor plan. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). Please no smoking or drinking.	30.305020874341196	-97.9275646566217	Guest house retreat in Hill Country TX	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13117051?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
