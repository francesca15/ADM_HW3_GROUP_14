nan	1	Houston	December 2016	Our comfortable tiny house (500sqft) has a full kitchen and restroom with a king-sized bed in a loft. We're within walking distance to downtown and Washington Avenue and a cheap Uber ride away from the Heights, Montrose, and sports venues. Our tiny house is in the Historic Sixth Ward, and a block away from the biking, walking, and running trails of the Buffalo Bayou. We have plenty of parking and welcome pets.
