$450	3	Bryan	January 2016	We are just 2 minutes from Texas A&amp;M University and tucked away in a very private wooded lot. For football weekends, you can walk (10 min), bike (5 min) or drive (2 min) to the equine center and catch the bus to the stadium. We have a wrap around deck out back with fire pit and plenty of space for tailgating outside and in with our man cave/bar garage. We are a 5 min drive to the airport, 5 min to northgate and about 10-15 min from Lake Bryan. We just added a hot tub that you will love!	30.6185311929809	-96.3783461059018	Traditions Bungalow Treehouse	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13432632?location=Bryan%2C%20TX
