$54	1	Dallas	January 2017	Walking distance to many restaurants and bars in Uptown's popular Knox/Henderson Avenue. Central to anywhere in Uptown, Elm Street, Greenville Ave, and Downtown Dallas. Youâ€™ll enjoy the walkability to all the restaurants, bars, and shops. With its own separate entrance, I'm told the suite has a hotel vibe. The view out the front window is Cochran Park with a tennis court. Cochran Heights is a quiet, quaint, perfectly located neighborhood. Good for solos, couples, and business travelers.	32.817684116918805	-96.78316266152001	Henderson Hideaway in Uptown Dallas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16973115?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
