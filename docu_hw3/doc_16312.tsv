$45	1	San Antonio	March 2013	My place is located in historic Dignowity Hill, just outside of downtown San Antonio. When you stay with me you will have a chance to unwind and walk to one of the many restaurants, bars, or breweries nearby. Or for less than $10 you could catch an Uber into the city and experience the cities main attractions (The Alamo, River walk, Alamodome, Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, Tobin Center, the Pearl Brewery). My place is great for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	29.4281705838059	-98.47496565001141	Private Bedroom & Bath in Historic Home Downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13780288?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
