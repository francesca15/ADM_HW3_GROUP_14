$375	4	Port Aransas	June 2017	This home sits in town, yet without much around it. The house sits on almost 1 acre of land and has a beautiful view of the ship channel. This house is accessible to all of town by golf cart and Kody's restaurant is just down the road (literally) and the beach is a half-mile away. The Dollar store, shopping, liquor store and a convenience store are all within walking distance! Everything you would need and ultimate privacy to BBQ on the back deck!	27.8179032877805	-97.0764377269511	The Lowly Oak	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19223459?location=Corpus%20Christi%2C%20TX
