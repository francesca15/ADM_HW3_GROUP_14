$60	1	San Antonio	March 2016	Quite, peaceful and safe. Anything and everything you want to eat within a 5 mile range. There are 2 HEB's, Walmart, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's within that distance as well. It is only a 15min drive from and to downtown and UTSA. I like to call it the center away from downtown. It takes no more then 15 mins to get anywhere. The airport is 10mins away. City buses do not pass through here but an Uber is only a call away!	29.6146504691093	-98.48716449195749	Home Away From Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16415592?location=Bulverde%2C%20TX
