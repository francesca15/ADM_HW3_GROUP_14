$47	2	Addison	January 2017	Locate about 12 miles north of downtown Dallas, my place is close to parks, major retailers and grocery, restaurants and dining, and a major corporate office area. It's situated 1/2 way between downtown sites and the rapidly grown North Dallas cities of Plano (Toyota) and Frisco. think guests appreciate the cool, casual design and quiet neighborhood that's still very close to public transport, bike paths and proximity to both DFW and Dallas Love.	32.9524486256132	-96.84603881149022	Comfort & Convenience in N.
