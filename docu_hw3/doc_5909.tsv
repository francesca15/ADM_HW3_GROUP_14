$89	3	Spring	July 2016	My place is close to parks, restaurants and dining, and great views. Kayaking, tennis, golf, bicycling, and swimming. You’ll love my place because of the outdoors space and the quiet neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). The Woodlands Mall is 15 minutes away and Downtown Houston only 40 minutes.
