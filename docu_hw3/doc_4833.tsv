$60	1	Fort Worth	December 2014	Perfect place for someone in town for downtown Fort Worth or the stockyards!  I live right in downtown so everything is in walking distance.   West 7th or the stockyards are both a short drive or uber away.	32.750669847737605	-97.33376790750842	Downtown FW - 13th Flr Guest Room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4848949?location=Burleson%2C%20TX
