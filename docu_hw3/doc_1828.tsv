$50	1	Pflugerville	October 2012	Location... 200 yards north of the Austin city limit. Seven minutes east of I-35. The bus terminal is half way between the house and the freeway. This is a quiet tree-lined area with plenty of groceries, drugstores and restaurants as well as big box stores along I-35 close by. Walnut Creek Park is a beautiful natural spot for a run or a few minutes by the creek. In good traffic, our exit is 15 minutes from downtown. Please note , there is no good traffic during South by Southwest. ENJOY!	30.4137851074819	-97.6486415971573	Zen Room in Music Loving House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17515816?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
