$59	1	Alpine	July 2015	Located in the heart of downtown Alpine, Texas, this separate, diminutive cottage(1 room and bath) was a teeny office (168sf) back in the day! It is almost like staying in a brick and mortar RV,but the bathroom is bigger than an RV bathroom! The bed is only a 3/4 bed(wider than a twin, but lass wide than a double)!!! This space is tiny and, yes, was photographed with wide angle lens to get the whole room in!! Enjoy the Backyard, adjacent to the Dragonfly Cottage!	30.3586718311464	-103.662563887663	The Dragonfly Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7515622?location=Alpine%2C%20TX
