$289	1	Horseshoe Bay	April 2015	My place is about 3 minutes from the Horseshoe Bay Resort and 8 minutes from Marble Falls. Youâ€™ll love the view over the pond, the relaxing ambiance, and the wildlife. My place is great for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.  Your room has all the hotel necessities. Help yourself to a drink from the fridge or enjoy a glass of wine on the deck.  This is one of two rooms that can be booked in my home. The rooms are right next to each other and each has a private bath.	30.542686214928302	-98.3539947090488	Waterfront room with private deck	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16078247?location=Buchanan%20Dam%2C%20TX
