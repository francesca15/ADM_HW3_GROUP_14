$85	1	Leander	March 2013	We are a British family with five children. Two of the five are teenage children living at home, and the others have gone to college/or are married. We live in a large, 2 story house in the outskirts of Austin (Leander). Our house is very close to the Metrorail train/bus station which runs to downtown Austin with several stops on the way.   The trains run all day and the last train out of Austin is at 12:30 am to Leander. This is a very inexpensive way to travel to and from the city center.   We have two guest bedrooms with a shared bathroom. Our guest rooms are connected to a 60ft gamesroom.  Our guests have access to the kitchen, the washer and dryer, the gamesroom, their own bedroom and bathroom, wifi, backyard, sunroom, and living rooms.   As little or as much as the guest would like. We know Austin very well, so we can advise you with places to visit and how to get there.   Our neighborhood is great. It has a pool and many different parks that are in walking distance. It is 20 minutes out of Downtown Austin, but there is easy access due to frequent buses and trains.   Metro Train/Bus Station is about 5 minutes from our house. It takes you to and from Austin almost anytime of the day, and its very cheap. It also has extended services during SXSW and ACL. If we are available, we can give the guests rides to the station.   We have a very large backyard with a sunroom that is available for guests!	30.5551345178165	-97.8357202017301	Austin, Texas (Leander)	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/978380?location=Bertram%2C%20TX
