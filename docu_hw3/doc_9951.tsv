$465	3	Burnet	June 2016	Our home is located on Inks Lake. It is a very nice older home that has been in our family for many years. We are constantly updating it. It is a wonderful place to kick back and relax and enjoy the water with wonderful water access both beach &amp; dock.  Every season has a special charm. Spring wildflowers bloom from March to May. Summer fun on the lake includes swimming, fishing, &amp; water sports. Great Fall weather and usually mild winters.	30.7380513138132	-98.3808009732298	Inks Lake Vacation Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13448044?location=Buchanan%20Dam%2C%20TX
