$160	1	Wimberley	December 2016	This is truly the romantic retreat you have been looking for or the cozy get-a-way from your responsibilities at home! You have it all at this private log cabin on top of the hill which overlooks the beautiful village of Wimberley.  My place is close to art and culture, restaurants and dining, and great views. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the outdoors space, the comfy bed, and the light. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	30.0038796346489	-98.06844878001792	Canyon Vista	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16404575?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
