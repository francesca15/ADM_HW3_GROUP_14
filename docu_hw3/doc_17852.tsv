$35	1	Addison	December 2013	Beautiful home with lots of character. I currently live here, and also work from home. I run a tech startup, which is why you'll see the living room is a pseudo working environment (great for those who work a lot like me) :-).   Feel free to ask me any other questions!	32.9493205182993	-96.8433780889486	Charming Living & Working Space in Addison	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16529731?location=Addison%2C%20TX
