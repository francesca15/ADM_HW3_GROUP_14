$100	2	Dallas	February 2011	Our beautiful, comfortable, historic Oak Cliff home is just 2 miles from the vibrant Bishop Arts District, 3.5 miles from Trinity Groves, and 3 miles from downtown Dallas, with a bus stop right outside the front door. The house is located on a busy street. That makes it easy to get around, but also means there is some traffic noise in the front of the house. The master bedroom is in the back and noise should not be an issue there.	32.744741899290396	-96.8570893132304	Lone Star Darling	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3230663?location=Cedar%20Hill%2C%20TX
