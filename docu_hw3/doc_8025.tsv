$48	1	Bastrop	August 2016	My house is close to restaurants and dining in downtown Bastrop, as well as a great river walk along the Colorado. Youâ€™ll love the high ceilings, wooden floors and the charm of staying in a historic home over 100 years old.   It is a great place for a romantic get away, or a longer stay in comfortable, calm and beautiful surroundings. It also works well for solo adventurers and business travelers. Only 30 minutes from Circuit of the Americas and 50 minutes from Austin.	30.118614198822698	-97.32388615186399	Historic Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14775041?location=Cedar%20Creek%2C%20TX
