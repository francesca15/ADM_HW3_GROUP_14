$45	1	College Station	September 2012	My apartment is on the top floor of a 4-plex, on a quiet side street within a short drive of Texas A&amp;M, and within walking distance or a short drive of restaurants and other shops. Big windows, an open living room, and spacious kitchen make this place feel bright, airy and welcoming. Perfect for visiting professionals and students, or fans in town for a game.  You will have your own bedroom and private half-bath (sink and toilet). There is a single shared shower.	30.614848230904396	-96.31015635645831	Private room with full-sized airbed near A&M	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11777580?location=Caldwell%2C%20TX
