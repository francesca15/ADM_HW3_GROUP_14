$300	1	Dale	October 2012	We'd like to welcome you to Austin and give you a great experience! We live about 7 miles from the F1 track and, for a negotiable additional charge, will be available to pick you up from the airport and be your chauffeur while you are in town. (Rental cars will be hard to come by during that week, so we'll just take you where you need to go. Also, we are on the opposite side of the track from Austin, so traffic should be much better headed from our house!) We are a married couple, and I am self-employed and able to dedicate my time to making sure you are taken care of while you are here. We have a big house in the country, with a beautiful back porch, and you will have plenty of space to stretch out and relax. This includes the huge master bedroom, which has a private bath with an oversized tub and his and hers sinks and toilets! We will drive you to the race when you are ready to go, and we will take you to explore anywhere in Austin or the surrounding hill country. We have lived in the area for over 13 years, and we love showing off our city. We also buy most of our produce from a local farmers market, so we will cook wonderful fresh meals for you when you are not trying some of the local barbeque and Tex Mex cuisine. We are very familiar with special dietary needs and can accommodate almost any diet. I am also a licensed acupuncturist and body-worker and would be happy to give each person a treatment when you arrive or sometime during your stay to help massage away the jet lag and stiffness that travel causes. We also will be happy to stock any toiletries of your preference--your favorite shampoo, etc.-- so you don't have to worry about flight limitations. We DO have cats, so anyone with allergies would be best advised to find another situation. Other than that, we love to host guests and would be thrilled to make your F1 experience a wonderful and memorable time.	30.0699704252527	-97.60086559137699	Austin Formula 1: Let us drive you!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/761841?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
