$35	1	San Antonio	March 2016	The place is close to the Airport, really convenient for travelers.  McAllister park is just around the corner. Perfect for someone that likes to walk &amp; run while enjoying the scenery. Park offers Bike Trails, Outdoor Fitness Areas &amp; Combined Large &amp; Small Dog Areas.   Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood; really quiet and relaxing.  My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).	29.564868823017303	-98.439086624432	Private Room w/Own Bathroom near Airport & Park	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15327482?location=Converse%2C%20TX
