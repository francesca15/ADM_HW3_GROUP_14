$155	5	Boerne	May 2015	My place is close to restaurants and dining and family-friendly hiking/bicycling trails, just twomblocks from shopping in old town , a block to a richly birded river park and a cat-bird seat to Boerne's endless celebrations, activities. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the people, the location, the outdoors space, and the ambiance. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups. We're dog lovers, collies and shelties..	29.7908068411716	-98.7280473524268	Hill Country Farm House B&B	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9179729?location=Boerne%2C%20TX
