$500	4	McKinney	May 2016	Texas Starlight Ranch sits on 18 acres of land and is also a nature preserve. My place is close to restaurants and dining and family-friendly activities. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the ambiance and the outdoors space. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups. Texas Starlight Ranch is also great for Holiday Parties for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years.	33.2191752768328	-96.55265029342979	Texas Starlight Ranch	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13113265?location=Allen%2C%20TX
