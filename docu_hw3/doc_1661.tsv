$105	2	Fort Worth	October 2014	This house will have you feeling like you're staying in the country when you're a 20-minute walk or 5-minute ride to Downtown! A bikeshare station on Samuels Ave. connects you to points of downtown including West 7th, museum district, magnolia, and the trinity trails. A train track near the house provides some ambient noise adding to a unique atmosphere. We loved while living in this house for over 8 years, renovating it for an open, connected, and modernized concept.	32.7665072085702	-97.3287367093026	1920's Bungalow / Craftsman near Downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7255032?location=Azle%2C%20TX
