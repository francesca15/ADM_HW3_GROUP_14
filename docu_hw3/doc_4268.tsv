$140	1	Wimberley	September 2011	Our guest house is comfortable, quiet and only 10 minutes from the village of Wimberley. Situated on an old farm complete with a small barn, vintage water tanks, chicken coops, several old outbuildings and the original rock farmhouse, our modern guest house offers a wireless internet connection, flat screen television, a microwave, toaster, small refrigerator, coffeemaker and plenty of dishes and silverware (but not a full kitchen.) There is an adorable upstairs loft-room with a queen-sized bed. Downstairs there is a full bath with a bathtub, a couch that makes into a bed, dining table and lots of interesting books and magazines to inspire you. The cottage has central air and heat to keep you comfortable in all seasons.   We have a large garden on our property and free-ranging chickens. Our family lives in the rock farmhouse which is near the guest house and we have two young children that enjoy having visitors and playing on the land.  The Wimberley town square is only 10 minutes away and our guest house is a 5 minute drive to Wimberley market days. We are located on the road to Blanco and are very close (in country miles) to Jacob's Well, Fischer Hall, Red Corral Ranch, Bella Vista Olive Mill and Winery, Texas Specialty Cut Flowers and many other interesting sites out here in the hill country.  Guests can wander around our property and enjoy time outside in several outdoor seating areas.  We live in the rock farmhouse that is only steps away from our guesthouse. We share the same parking area and road with the guests and often say \	30.043768155391398	-98.1713468063851	Wild Plum Cottage - Wimberley, Tx	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/221985?location=Colorado%20River%2C%20TX
