$145	1	Lago Vista	August 2012	A newly built beautiful bungalow with a fantastic view of our Lake Travis. This is a great getaway spot for a couple looking to relax and enjoy the lake scenery after a round of golf, kayaking, biking, hiking... Or just read a book and the peace and quiet.  This get away spot is a one bedroom and one bath with all the amenities. A large kitchen will satisfy the cooks and a fantastic bar will do for the one that just like to take in the action with a beverage of choice.  There are 2 1/2 golf courses within 4 miles. Starting at a cool low price of 14 per person.  The bungalow is approximately 1080 sqft. with a designated covered carport.  There is satellite TV with a 150 channels and dvd player for the cozy nights in.  This could be a great place for a couple looking for some quiet time or a pair of snowbirds looking for some warm months. We can arrange to stock the kitchen for short stays so you can concentrate in having fun and relaxing. There are a few restaurants close by in case you want to have lunch or diner out.  Of course there is Austin; full of eateries, shopping and live music is just 55 minutes away. Other short drives will take you to our beautiful hill country.  The Austin airport is also about 1hr away.   The bungalow is private and peaceful. The golf course is a very short drive away. The central deck is shared with the other side, which is sometimes occupied by the owners.   We always try to meet the guests to show them around, hand them a key and make sure they have everything they need. Otherwise the guest privacy is respected.  The Bungalow is the perfect retreat for the couple that wants a quiet place to relax. There is the perfect combination of activities like golf, tennis, hikes, and lake side. There are several spa locally just to make sure this getaway can be taken to the next relaxation level.   The bungalow has ample parking. The Austin airport is about 1 hour away.
