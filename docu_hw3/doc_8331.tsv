$125	1	Center Point	June 2015	Set under a canopy of cypress trees and facing verde creek (it truly looks green), this little cabin is truly a place of “peace and tranquility.” You’ll spend most of your time sitting on the back porch taking in the beauty of the creek. There always seems to be a breeze blowing through which provides a breath of freshness to your being. The trees are majestic. We call the largest one down by the creek, “the tree of life”. Our place is good for couples and solo adventurers.	29.9234788171344	-99.0430150148279	Verde Creek Retreat - Peace & Tranquility	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6932112?location=Center%20Point%2C%20TX
