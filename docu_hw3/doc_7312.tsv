$50	1	Converse	March 2016	I'm an attorney with college &amp; middle school age exceptional kids. My place is close to restaurants, retail and major shopping venues, dining, and family-friendly activities. You'll love my place because of the comfy bed, peacefulness, and close proximity to Interstate 10 and 35. Downtown San Antonio is 30 minutes. Downtown Austin is 55 minutes. A lot of active duty and military retirees live in my friendly neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	29.521885347538902	-98.29684932222379	Classy and clean home near Randolph AFB	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13041033?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
