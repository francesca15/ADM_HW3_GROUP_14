$35	1	San Antonio	May 2015	Nice, quiet home on the corner close to tons food and shopping. Backyard is large and perfect for lounging around. We are not to far from downtown if you're just going for a day. But we're definitely closer to where the good beer is made.	29.4345968953933	-98.6797135799543	Quiet comfortable room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13208315?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
