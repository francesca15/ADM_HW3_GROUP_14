$75	1	Fort Worth	July 2012	Our little backyard escape is a detached apartment/room with a nice large shower and bathroom. There is a queen size bed, TV with cable, Air conditioner / heater, mini fridge &amp; a coffee maker (along with use of a grill and patio). The room is not huge but it is nice and cozy and has everything anyone would need for a short term stay (1 day to 1 week). The apartment is located in a vibrant historic neighborhood just one mile from Fort Worth museums (Modern, Amon Carter, Kimbell, Science &amp; History) and the Will Rogers Coliseum (Rodeo). It is also close to West 7th (new restaurants, bars, shopping) and walking distance to a wine bar (Winslow's) and Gingerman (beer pub) among other things. It's about 3 miles from Downtown Fort Worth (Sundance Square, etc). There is a two car driveway so there's a parking spot (or more if needed) right in front of the apartment. There is a park and community center (with gym) 1/2 block away and a school with a track, basketball courts and exercise circuit 1/2 block away.  Public transportation is close, with a bus stop 2 blocks away, and we'd be happy to lend a bicycle to anyone looking to check out the area on bike.   Feel free to lay on the hammock in the backyard, sit on the back porch, use the grill or anything else in the backyard. If you need a garage parking spot, we can try to accommodate.  We love interacting with guests when we're around and if guests are in the mood to talk.  We respect our guests space and understand if guests prefer to just enjoy the peace and quiet.  Our neighborhood is very friendly and active and when the weather is comfortable, there are lots of folks walking, exercising, playing at the park and socializing. Most homes were built in the 1920's - 1930's and have been renovated.  We are close to shopping and restaurants, although there are only a few within short walking distance.  There is a bus stop 2 blocks away which can quickly take you to the museums or downtown.  If you have a car, feel free to park in our driveway or on the street. From the airport, our place is about a 45 minute drive. You can also take the TRE to downtown Fort Worth and a bus or taxi from there, but it will take a couple of hours to go this route.	32.740884724233	-97.37939951756809	Backyard escape - private, detached	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/585381?location=Burleson%2C%20TX
