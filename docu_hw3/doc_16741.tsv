$30	1	McKinney	August 2013	This sunny bedroom in my Vintage Cottage Home has off street parking and it's own private entrance through a picket fence gate. My home is in the Historic District near The Square with easy access to all Highways.   McKinney is one of the best places to live &amp; have fun according to a bunch of sources. It's a Marvelous place to Shop, Dine &amp; Enjoy &amp; is Unique by Nature. The house has been painted a bright peach with a multi-color picket fence. It'll be easy to find!	33.2039255948117	-96.62520987670709	Garden Gate Getaway	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4211181?location=Anna%2C%20TX
