$132	3	Houston	June 2015	My place is close to nightlife, public transport, the city center and parks. It is good for couples, business travelers, families (with kids), and groups. All 3 bedrooms have new high thread count sheets, towels and are equipped with new flat panel TVs: AppleTV, Sling TV (cable), HBO, Netflix and Hulu. In addition, all bathrooms have travel soaps, shampoos, conditioners and lotions. My goal is to make this the best stay possible and I appreciate your comments and suggestions.	29.805030843579303	-95.4162447329703	Houston Heights area.
