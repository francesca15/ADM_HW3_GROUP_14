$200	2	Marble Falls	December 2013	Close to Austin, this waterfront 60's 2/1 is a perfect weekend getaway. There are Beatles' puzzles, retro furniture and an ever expanding collection of campy 60's DVDs. A visit to Flatcreek Estate Winery next door is a must. They recently open a regulation Frisbee golf course.	30.4737763404475	-98.0365103950676	Groovy 60's Waterfront Lake House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5919043?location=Briarcliff%2C%20TX
