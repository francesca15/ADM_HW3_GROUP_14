$55	1	Irving	April 2015	My place is close to both the DFW and Love Field airports. They're both about a 15 minute drive away (depending on the Dallas traffic, of course.)   Youâ€™ll love my place because of the ambiance, the outdoor space, the natural light, and the neighborhood. It's located across from the Las Colinas Country Club and the Four Seasons resort. It's nice, quiet, and just a 20 minute drive to downtown Dallas. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	32.8554349741832	-96.9508294033162	cozy apt near airports	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13256966?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
