$45	1	Austin	October 2010	This is a lovely quiet room in a south Austin home. My home is away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Austin, but incredibly convenient if you'd like to get there by bus and avoid the hassle of parking! A day pass will cost you a mere $2.50, and there's a direct bus into the heart of downtown!  I live in the home with a very friendly and talkative senior kitty and my friend, a 50-something adult man (who you will share the bathroom with).	30.188657075720897	-97.78940159635859	Private room/ direct bus to downtown!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/54628?location=Buda%2C%20TX
