$115	1	Edom	October 2015	Step back in time to a place where you can just sit back and relax among the tall pines of East Texas. Emmer's cabin is a sweet little cabin perfect for a weekend getaway. We invite you to take a walk on the hiking trails and see all of what nature provides. Maybe a cookout on the grill for the evening would be fun or even a little fishing in the well stocked lake. Whichever you choose, its your time to relax and unwind.	32.3747004604437	-95.53839259755951	"Emmer's Cabin ""So Sweet"""	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9217880?location=Athens%2C%20TX
