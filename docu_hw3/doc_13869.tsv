$209	4	Rockport	October 2015	This beauty has features to appeal to many tastes. Fishermen: on the canal, boat dock, fish cleaning stand with lights and running water. Painters: phenomenal canal views and constant breezes. See my reviews about starlight views from upper deck. Close to restaurants and dining, and the best fishing in Texas. Youâ€™ll love the pristine beaches, vibrant community. My place is good for families (with kids) and big groups.	28.040505423815397	-97.027822729816	Waterfront canal home, decks with views, breezes	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15813103?location=Bayside%2C%20TX
