$150	2	San Antonio	April 2014	Our home, built in 1920, was recently brought back to life - but many of the originals details remain. We are less than two miles from AT&amp;T Center, Pearl Brewery, Alamodome, Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, San Antonio Museum of Art, Majestic Theater, and The Alamo - less than a mile from Fort Sam Houston - and a very short drive to the Witte Museum and Alamo Heights and Olmos Park areas. Youâ€™ll love the location, ambiance, and extreme attention to detail and comfort.	29.4399422098087	-98.4604389964504	The Cozy Abode	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16871516?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
