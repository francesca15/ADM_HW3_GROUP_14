$300	1	South Padre Island	August 2015	My modern and simple decor is perfect for a small family looking for a great condo right on the beach. The view from the balcony and easy access to the beach make it the perfect location for your family getaway. I have listed the condo and priced it as a one bedroom, but I do have a small bonus room with a bunk bed, 2 twins, that I will leave open for your use. Due to the size I do not advertise it as a second bedroom.
