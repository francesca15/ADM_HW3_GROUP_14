$42	2	Austin	June 2012	I'd like to host women traveling solo or couples over 30 years of age. At the most right now I can host 2 couples in the same party at one time, you will have the 2 bedrooms and the hall bath.   Fantastic home with hip, fun, retro-modern vibe. Great location just 20 min. to downtown Austin, a quick trip to the airport and only 10 minutes to the Hill Country Galleria. Easy access to major roads and highways.   Must like dogs! I have 2 and they will want to meet you, but are well behaved.	30.236578205027598	-97.8799519156826	Retro-Modern Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15359851?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
