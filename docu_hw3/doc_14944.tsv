$75	2	Houston	July 2016	Welcome to our pride and joy!   This is a great group spot! Our small home is in an urban setting, but this means we are close to the city! Check out the photos to get a sense of our surroundings.  3 or less miles from rodeo, downtown, medical center, U of H, TSU, Rice Village, you name it!  Across the street from the grocery store and the drugstore if you need something really quick.	29.6994428065385	-95.35728876465109	Urban gem by NRG, Med ctr, Midtown, and Toyota ctr	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17047090?location=Baytown%2C%20TX
