$175	2	Austin	January 2017	The luxury 2 bed/2bath 1097 sq ft. apartment will be entirely yours. No one physically lives here - this is run like a hotel with a full-time cleaning crew. If there is anything you would like to request before arrival let us know!   Located just blocks from UT and about 20 blocks from downtown (easy biking distance, or there is a bus stop 1 block away). This is an apartment that we use to host international professors/scholars coming to UT, and when we have open dates we'd love to host you!	30.2925273608746	-97.72244558215309	40 - Luxury 2 Bdrm, 2 Bath - University Park	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17028600?location=Austin%2C%20TX
