$149	2	Austin	August 2016	Why stay in an expensive hotel when you could enjoy Austin from my immaculate, new townhouse for a fraction of the price! My place is right across the street from St Edwards University on a quiet street. It features a tankless hot water heater, a full size washer and dryer, LED lighting, and individual air conditioning units for each room. It is 1/2 mile from the dynamic South Congress and 1/2 mile from I-35. Driving from my townhouse, it only takes 5 minutes to the heart of downtown Austin.	30.224668731961398	-97.75337779063541	Stunning Austin SoCo 2/1: Highlands of Willowrun	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14820133?location=Colorado%20River%2C%20TX
