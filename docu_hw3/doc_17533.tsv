$300	2	Garfield	September 2014	Our RV is a vintage 1955 Spartan Imperial Mansion- it has been completely renovated to todays standards. Enjoy expansive views from the large operable windows and the 400 square foot deck with outdoor seating.  Located on the Colorado River with Stand Up Paddle Boarding and Kayaking. If desired we can drop you and the kayak up river for an all day float- it's truly amazing! You have access to the acreage and to hang out with the goats/sheep and horses as desired.   As much or as little as wanted. You can never see us or come have a beer on our porch (our house is not visible from the trailer)  We are located only 20 minutes from Austin and 10 minutes from ABIA. We LOVE the close proximity to Austin but also that we are far enough away to get away from it all. Being on the river makes our place feel like a true vacation without having to travel all day to get to!  The only public transportation available are cabs  Even though we are only 20 minutes from Austin we are still out in the \	30.2143632279613	-97.54309319207741	Amazing view on the Colorado River	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4065765?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
