$99	1	Bryan	July 2015	I have two rooms/two bathrooms available in my home. My home is very clean and is in a safe and quiet neighborhood. You will have a private bedroom and bathroom and full use of the kitchen. No meals provided. When I rent out the space, I usually sleep on the couch, so I'll likely be there, but won't be a distraction, if you prefer we are not there, please let us know and we will attempt to accommodate. Only about 6 minutes from campus. Gig'em Aggies!	30.626157293484603	-96.3856537579467	Nice Space in Safe Neighborhood	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7198456?location=Caldwell%2C%20TX
