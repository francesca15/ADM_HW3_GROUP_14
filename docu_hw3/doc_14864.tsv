$70	1	Denton	September 2016	My place is close to nightlife, public transport, the airport, family-friendly activities, College life, Dallas metro area. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the views, the location, the people, and the ambiance. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. I am not picky about your lifestyle just be courteous and respectful. Denton has been referred as the smaller Austin. It has a relaxed vibe and is a chill step away from the Dallas energy.	33.2128571108979	-97.163978490763	Mi casa es su casa	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14912564?location=Argyle%2C%20TX
