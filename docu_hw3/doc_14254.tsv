$45	1	Austin	September 2014	Comfortable and private, the garden bedroom is ideal for a long weekend or festival stay. It features a private closet, a full-sized bed and a lovely view of the backyard.   Common spaces are here for your use as well. Cook a meal and stick to your travel budget, sit in the living room front window with a cup of coffee and watch the peacocks in the morning or enjoy the sunshine and garden from the back patio.   If being out and about in Austin is your goal, our neighborhood is central and there are many easy options for getting around the city. We have and love dogs. Please get in touch if you would like to bring yours!  There are so many things to love about our neighborhood. Not only are we super close to great parkland, bars, restaurants, coffee shops, food trailers and vintage shops, we're surrounded by huge live oaks and peacocks! The neighbors are open and friendly and have made us feel welcome from the start. Some of our favorite places include Skylark Lounge, Contigo, Dai Due, Sugar Mama's, Coldtowne Theater, The Work Horse, Foreign and Domestic, Drink Well, Kome, Tyson's Tacos, Room Service Vintage, Uptown Modern, Michi Ramen, Big Bertha's and Lucy's Fried Chicken. We also really dig our backyard patio and grill, and we think you will, too.  Our neighborhood connects directly to the Mueller Greenway trails, putting guests less than a mile away from The Thinkery and Mueller Park (they have a great Farmer's Market on Sundays and a beautiful loop for walkers and runners alike). By bike, take the Greenway two miles west to UT, North Loop or Hyde Park, take it a mile southeast to Cherrywood or Manor Road, five miles further and you're in the thick of the East Side &amp; downtown without ever having to leave a bike lane. If cycling is not your thing, shared rides are abundant (getme is a good app) as are Car To Go cars. There is also a bus stop less than two blocks from the house, and we are two miles from the Capmetro station at Highland. I-35 is literally a stone's throw from the house, putting you just a few exits from wherever you want to be in Austin. If you are interested, we can provide bike rental services and route recommendations.  We have two dogs, one big and one small. Although we are responsible owners and you will find the house clean, please consider this if you are afraid of dogs or have allergies. On the other hand, if you would like to bring your well-behaved dog, please reach out and we will see if this can be arranged.
