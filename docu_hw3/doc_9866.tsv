$175	3	Horseshoe Bay	April 2015	Great location. Right across the street from the resort. Just a one minute walk to the resort and take the shuttle to the yacht club or simply stroll around the gardens and enjoy the tropical birds. I have two units and with planning both units can be rented for weddings, family reunions, etc. This complex has a private swimming pool. Please contact me if you only need one bedroom or two and I can price accordingly.	30.546352580658397	-98.3607451746023	3 Bedroom/3 Bath Getaway	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18624999?location=Burnet%2C%20TX
