$200	2	Burnet	January 2017	My place is close to Lake Buchanan in Burnet, Texas The house has 60 feet of waterfront footage. You can go kayaking, sit on the floating dock to sun bath, fish from the pier, have a bond fire or BBQ on the grill.  You'll love my place because you have the lake on one side and the hill country on the other. The house is fully furnished with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.
