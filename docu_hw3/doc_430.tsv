$54	1	Austin	December 2015	My place is close to a creek, nature, shopping. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the comfy bed, big patio, quiet area, the great hiking trails. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.  I have a private bedroom with a queen bed and private access to a bathroom. I also have a pull out queen sized sofa very close to the guest bathroom.	30.383004287361	-97.76838274070921	Apartment in NW Hills, Arboretum, Capital of Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12948242?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
