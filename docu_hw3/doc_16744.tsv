$33	1	Bells	December 2015	My place is only 20 minutes away from Sherman, Denison or Bonham. It is a secluded, quiet, working farm setting where you can camp. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the seclusion, the interaction with nature, the ability to walk around or hike on the property, watching the farm animals, the opportunity to help take care of them if desired, possibly gather your own eggs, cook out, have a camp fire, roast marshmallows.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and families (with kids).	33.5811872700937	-96.3993790217115	Cozy Tent Camper on a Working Farm	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13388554?location=Anna%2C%20TX
