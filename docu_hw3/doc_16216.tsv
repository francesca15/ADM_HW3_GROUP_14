$125	1	Galveston	July 2016	My place is a lazy 5 min walk to the beach. Centrally located, a 10 min drive gets you anywhere on the Island! This upstairs garage apt is great for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and pets (under 30 lbs with approval).  *Each dog is considered an extra guest and extra guest fee applies!  We know the Island well and provide a list of our favorite places to go and things to do. We also provide freshly ground coffee and Greek Yogurt for breakfast.	29.2797848310418	-94.8095180380432	Simple Rentals	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14071329?location=Bayou%20Vista%2C%20TX
