$100	1	Georgetown	July 2016	Our cottage is close to Georgetown, the airport, the university, and parks. You will have the feel of being in the country, but only 3 miles from the city of Georgetown. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets). We are located east of Georgetown on a private road. The view from the cottage is the city of Georgetown and Southwestern University. We are 1/2 a mile from the toll road and 30 minutes from Austin Bergstrom International Airport.	30.6469221385249	-97.6427654973628	Jesse Cooper Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14164507?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
