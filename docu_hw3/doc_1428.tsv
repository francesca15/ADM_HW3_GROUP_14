$24	1	Humble	February 2014	Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, families, &amp; solo adventurers. I provide clean, safe, &amp; comfortable accommodations. First time Airbnb guests are always welcomed. Communication is essential. PLEASE NOTE: All guests MUST BE ID verified Airbnb members with a visible profile picture before booking. My home is NOT smoker friendly as I have asthma and cannot be around smoke.	29.9844360525734	-95.19598508492778	5 Star Quality Private RM & Bath Near IAH Airport	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4483842?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
