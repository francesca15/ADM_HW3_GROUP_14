$235	2	Wimberley	March 2012	Paper Moon is a lovely log cabin nestled amongst oaks and elms in the quiet countryside, just 1.5 miles from downtown Wimberley. You’ll cross a scenic low water crossing over Pierce Creek, a wet-weather creek that runs through the front of the property, as you drive in. This spacious cabin was lovingly hand-built by a local Wimberley couple in 1985, and has been recently renovated by the current owners while retaining its rustic charm. It’s an ideal spot for family and friend gatherings, but also perfect for a romantic couple’s retreat. You can make the short drive into town for the wonderful shopping and dining in Wimberley, or you can stay at the cabin and soak up the serenity. Watch the deer graze as you enjoy your morning coffee from the front porch rocking chairs, have a family bbq on the spacious covered deck, roll a cooler out to the veranda and enjoy an evening in the hot tub and around the fire pit, or just snuggle up inside by the wood burning stove and feel the stress of your daily life melt away.  At Paper Moon you get the privacy and serenity of a country home with all the amenities of modern life. The house has two baths, two bedrooms (king bed, queen futon, queen bed), and a large loft (queen bed). Add that to the charming living room with a fold-out couch and wood burning stove, a dining room with seating for 8, a hot tub, abundant outdoor seating, a fire pit, and the large covered deck with a bbq pit, and you’ve got the perfect space for your vacation! At Paper Moon the owners are environmentally conscious. They offer full recycling, use environmentally friendly dish and laundry soap, provide recycled paper products, provide a water filtration pitcher to eliminate the need for bottled water, and landscape with native low-water plants.   The name Paper Moon comes from a popular portrait fad that began in the late 19th century. It was an inexpensive and fun way to have one’s portrait taken and paper moon booths were often set up at fairs and carnivals. We enjoy these vintage portraits which often depict folks with big grins having a good time, unlike traditional portraits of the time. As you meander from room to room in our charming cabin you’ll find vintage paper moon photos hanging on the walls.    We are confident that Paper Moon will exceed your expectations. The owners really go out of their way to add those special touches to make your trip complete, such as providing firewood for the fire pit, and keeping the kitchen stocked with condiments and basics that you may have forgotten. You won’t want to leave Paper Moon, but you can always come back for another visit!   Pet policy: Pets allowed at $50 per pet and we ask that you leave cash or check for the pet fee with the keys upon checkout. Pets must be declared to the owners in advance, preferably at the time of booking. We ask that if dogs are left unattended at the cabin that they be crated.
