$495	3	Manchaca	November 2014	My place is close to the airport, public transport, parks, and the city center. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the fact that it feels like you are out in the country but you are only minutes from restaurants and about 15-20 minutes from downtown Austin. This ranch style home has been updated throughout with a modern flair and features a gourmet kitchen, lots of open airy spaces and beautiful views from every window.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	30.1297447604297	-97.884404425414	Merryvale	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15068498?location=Buda%2C%20TX
