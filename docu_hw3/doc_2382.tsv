$45	1	Pflugerville	July 2016	Welcome to the Great Basin Cottage! This charming craftsman style home is in a quite neighborhood situated on a corner lot across from a greenbelt. The house is just minutes away from Circuit of the Americas, Dell, Austin, and much more. You will have your own room and bathroom as well as access to kitchen, living, dining and laundry. I do live in the house full-time with my boyfriend and dog, but we can be more present or absent, depending on your needs!	30.4613695566065	-97.6191243311883	Great Basin Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13921102?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
