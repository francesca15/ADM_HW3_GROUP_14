$99	Studio	McKinney	February 2016	My efficiency studio loft apartment is close to the old downtown Mckinney town square. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the newly remodeled professional designer quality, the neighborhood is quiet and family oriented, the kitchen has all appliances and white granite counter top and country harvest sink, the coziness is palpable in this loft apartment. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	33.20791937727589	-96.6187623948682	Loft Mckinney	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16029469?location=Celina%2C%20TX
