$400	2	Houston	October 2016	Located in the Historical Heights, my place is close to Downtown (10 min), our well-renowned medical center (10min), several parks, and our city's art and culture district. It is walking distance to many restaurants and shops. Youâ€™ll love my place because of its coziness and central location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	29.7932242686556	-95.38923666484209	Traditional Style in the Historical Heights	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15545892?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
