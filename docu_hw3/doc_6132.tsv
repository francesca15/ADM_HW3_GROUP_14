$28	1	Katy	July 2016	My place is close to restaurants and dining, family-friendly activities. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location, the views ( quiet and safe neighborhood with walking paths, lots of green zones, 2 lakes at walking distance) located closed to the energy corridor, Typhoon Texas, Katy Mills Mall and stores ; only 20 minutes from west Houston . My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	29.704151239179602	-95.8228055837016	Family home in quiet neighboorhood	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14089533?location=Cinco%20Ranch%2C%20TX
