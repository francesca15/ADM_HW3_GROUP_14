$79	1	Houston	June 2013	My spacious apartment in SW Houston is just minutes from NRG Stadium, Galleria Mall &amp; Meyerland shopping center. This 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment is great for a single traveller or a group. Bring your bathing suit, because the pool is right outside of the door to the right! My space has a comfortable full size bed &amp; pull out sofa bed for groups. There is a grocery store and pharmacy less than 2 blocks away. For exercise, there is a walking trail along the apartment this leads to NRG stadium.	29.6777040742169	-95.4822860474338	Meyerland 1 BD 1BA Apt. near Galleria NRG Stadium	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18509571?location=Bellaire%2C%20TX
