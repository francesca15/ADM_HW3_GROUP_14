$58	1	Irving	October 2015	Youâ€™ll love my home because it's 5-10 minutes from the DFW airport, located in the center of Dallas/ Ft. Worth metroplex so you won't ever have to drive from one extreme end to the other. Parking is easy and safe with surveillance camera on all parking lot for additional safety, quiet, family friendly neighborhood, fits 4 people comfortably, and best of all, it is very clean and cozy. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families with kids.	32.8412848219315	-97.01444876662941	Center of DFW - Next to Airport	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14339305?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
