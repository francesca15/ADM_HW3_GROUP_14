$17	1	Irving	April 2016	Do you need a safe, comfortable, and affordable place to stay for one/two nights? Look no further - this is what you need! If your flight got cancelled and you need a place to stay for the night - then come on over! You'd be sleeping on a queen size Air bed or the futon in the common area upstairs. This is not a private room. My Airbnb guests stay upstairs, and my family stays downstairs. The location is very convenient - we are near every major highway in DFW and the Las Colinas business area.	32.9189709535547	-96.9516709890913	Restful Loft! w/ Comfortable Bed in Shared Space	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19333133?location=Colleyville%2C%20TX
