$72	1	Houston	June 2015	My home is open to positive, relaxing and serene energy. My beautiful home has an Afro-Centric field to it that reminds me of the continent of Africa. I have 1 entrance door, an attached garage that can also be used as an entry way and a patio to either hangout outside and enjoy the beauty of what nature has to offer. I am between Deerbrook Mall and Willow Brook mall and an entire strip of multicultural food. Come and enjoy my Gated Kingdom you will love it.	30.0085284715122	-95.45133877646792	Luxurious Afrocentric Condo	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19161886?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
