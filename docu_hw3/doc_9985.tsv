$89	1	Austin	August 2015	We built this cabin for friends and family to stay in. The design and decor was inspired by the early Texas homes in the Hill Country. It is almost entirely made from reclaimed wood, doors, windows, etc. It is small but very comfortable and unique. It's in our back yard under large old Live Oak trees.	30.249472813443198	-97.9211565455802	Newly built antique tiny house	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8143666?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
