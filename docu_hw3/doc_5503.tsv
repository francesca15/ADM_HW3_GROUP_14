$50	1	Irving	October 2016	My place is 5-10 minutes from DFW. It is less than a mile away from the North Lake College DART Station and right on the #501 bus line. If I'm available, I'm also willing to help out with rides in exchange for a gratuity. My place is close to restaurants, shopping, movies, etc. My place is great for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and airport layovers.	32.866131949643105	-96.98194509621379	Minutes from DFW	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17605149?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
