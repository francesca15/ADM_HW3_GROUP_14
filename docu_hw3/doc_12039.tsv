$140	2	Bellville	August 2016	Our place is close to everything in this nice little town. Youâ€™ll love our place because of the porch, the high ceilings, the separate dining room &amp; kitchen, the pine floors, &amp; the 1920's construction. Our grandfather Gus &amp; his future brother in law built it for Gus &amp; Hallie to live &amp; raise a family in once married. Our place is pretty big so good for couples, business travelers, and families (with older kids).   Close proximity to Antique shopping in Roundtop, Fayetteville, Brenham and Sealy.	29.9447500680017	-96.2625043541259	Gus & Hallie's Place	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14831206?location=Cat%20Spring%2C%20TX
