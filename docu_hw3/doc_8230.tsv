$100	2	College Station	September 2012	My apartment is on the top floor of a 4-plex, on a quiet side street within a short drive of Texas A&amp;M, and within walking distance (or a short drive) of shops and restaurants. Big windows allow in tons of natural light, and an open living room and kitchen make this place spacious and welcoming.
