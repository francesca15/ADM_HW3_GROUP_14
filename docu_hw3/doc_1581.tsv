$85	2	Houston	November 2014	My home is primarily used a long term rental. I invite you into my home to share and experience what I love about the Heights neighborhood so much! I will always have some beer and food in the pantry for you, and welcome all furry friends. I hope you choose to stay with me as I love to meet new people and enjoy sharing the joys I have found in this neighborhood. It is centrally located and you're about 15 minutes from all major Houston areas and close to many of my favorite watering holes!	29.8095387451298	-95.42010136770809	2 Bedroom Townhome in Heights Area	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11938136?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
