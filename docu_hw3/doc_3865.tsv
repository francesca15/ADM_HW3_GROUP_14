$59	1	The Woodlands	July 2012	This is a perfect home away from home. It has everything any five star luxury hotel suite has to offer and much more with a personal and home like feel. You'll have the place entirely to yourself.  The kitchen is fully equipped. There's also a balcony. The Location is ideal as you're walking distance to Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, the Waterway, restaurants, a walking trail, Market street, and two cinemas. Amazing!  Minutes drive to Grocery store.  You're sure to enjoy your stay!
