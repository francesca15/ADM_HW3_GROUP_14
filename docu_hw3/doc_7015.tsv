$145	3	Bay City	March 2014	Coastal home built in 2015 with views of Old Caney Creek, the Intracoastal Waterway and the Gulf of Mexico. Great place to relax and unwind. Watch the sunrise from the front deck or the sunset from downstairs. Just south of Surfside and north of Matagorda, Sargent is a sleepy fishing village. Has a great beach for beach combers and some of the best fishing on the Texas Gulf Coast. Because of its close proximity to San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge, Sargent is a great place to bird watch.	28.7700024804563	-95.626767262434	Barge Inn Rental - Sargent TX	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17860878?location=Bay%20City%2C%20TX
