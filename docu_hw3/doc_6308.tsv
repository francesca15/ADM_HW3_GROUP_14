$120	Studio	Granbury	August 2015	My place is close to parks, restaurants and dining, and the beach. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the outdoors space, the neighborhood--just minutes from the Historic Square and shopping, but also only 20 minutes to the state park for hiking and swimming. Full breakfasts included that will keep you coming back for more!. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	32.412315633538	-97.78774610914101	Cowboy Cabin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15368728?location=Cleburne%2C%20TX
