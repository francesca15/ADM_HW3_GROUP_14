$62	1	Austin	November 2013	After enjoying airbnb in 5 continents I am looking forward to opening my clean, comfortable and convenient home to travelers. This is a small and friendly community within walking distance to SoCo (bars n eats), convenient to I-35 and downtown, easy parking (trust me, this is great in Austin) and a nice pool to relax in when the day is done. What more do you want!? (Queso... you want queso). Come kick your boots off and stay a while :)	30.2378027404202	-97.7477435820557	Clean, Comfortable and Convenient in SoCo 78704	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13331419?location=Austin%2C%20TX
