$254	1	Brenham	December 2015	As soon as you see the unique mahogany door, you will know you are someplace special. The master bedroom has a solid oak hand-carved king headboard. The bay window looks out onto the countryside, and the beadboard ceiling provides an open, airy feel to the room. There is a separate bath with marble tiled floor, large shower and hand-painted double sinks. The wooden footbridge, stone walkway, exterior chimney, rosemary hedge, and rose bushes complete the English cottage look.	30.241603717698304	-96.2283358590259	Fairytale Cottage with Hot Tub	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14807059?location=Brenham%2C%20TX
