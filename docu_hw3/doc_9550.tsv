$105	Studio	Bastrop	April 2015	Bastrop Carriage House is close to nightlife, the airport, family-friendly activities and thirty minutes to the Formula One, Austin's ACL and SXSW annual events. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, the location, and the people; the carriage house is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). In the historic district surrounded by architecture and fabulous restaurants, great for walking. 1 Bed, 2nd sleeping loft.
