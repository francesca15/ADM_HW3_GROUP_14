$55	1	Austin	June 2015	The peaceful vibe of being in the country, but only 15 minutes from downtown or the airport and 10 min from UT. Spacious room with a comfy queen bed, reclaimed wood headboard, bamboo floors and great natural light. My house is on a quiet residential street, surrounded by big trees, a creek and a half acre of green that you can enjoy from the extra-big backyard deck.  I have a second room if needed for groups of up to 4. I rent both rooms in March and October during the big music festivals.	30.318493230603103	-97.6749128670084	Big bright room in leafy oasis	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7690676?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
