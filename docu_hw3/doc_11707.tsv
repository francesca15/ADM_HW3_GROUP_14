$225	3	Canyon Lake	October 2016	My place is close to a free boat ramp, fishing pier, beach, several other parks on Canyon lake, family-friendly activities, halfway between Austin and San Antonio and minutes from tubing. Many beautiful hill country towns close by. Youâ€™ll love my place because it is nestled in the center of a 32.5 acre ranch with views of the creek, hill country, and gorgeous sunsets! . My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	29.9506881988346	-98.2718049447105	Ranch on Potters Creek at Canyon Lake	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15636222?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
