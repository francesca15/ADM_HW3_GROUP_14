$523	4	Wimberley	December 2016	The first time you drive up the cool stone driveway of this beautiful vacation retreat, you will be unsure of what to appreciate first: the beautiful serenity of the sun streaming through the large oak trees. The 600+ feet of gorgeous river frontage just a short three minute walk from the house, there is also a paved road down to the river if you prefer to drive. Beautiful Cypress trees in abundance between the property and the Blanco River.	29.9680063506211	-98.1886983805323	Dome River House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18993594?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
