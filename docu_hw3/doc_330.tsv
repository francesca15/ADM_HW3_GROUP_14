$139	3	Arlington	December 2014	This is our home when we visit our grandchildren--it has been recently remodeled and stocked with top-of-the-line mattresses, sheets, towels, etc. Fully stocked kitchen. As former Texans, we picked this location for the convenience. We are about 1/2 mile from ATT (Cowboys) Stadium, Globe Life (Rangers) Stadium, Arlington Convention Center, and about a mile from Six Flags &amp; Hurricane Harbor; 20 minutes to both Dallas and Ft Worth, and within walking distance of shopping and restaurants.	32.7553808707152	-97.0910779372461	Updated, Comfy Home in Entertainment District	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18348479?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
