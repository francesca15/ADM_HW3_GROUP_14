$90	1	Austin	May 2012	Easy access to downtown, Convention Center, Rainey St, and E. 6th St. Plenty of street parking, but no car is really needed. Our place is great for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.  This is a great spot if you're looking for a quiet, clean place to stay with all the amenities of downtown. We have a dog that is very friendly and she offers belly rubs for free!	30.2589935046174	-97.7315932481048	New Home: Private Room and Easy Walk to Downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5280717?location=Austin%2C%20TX
