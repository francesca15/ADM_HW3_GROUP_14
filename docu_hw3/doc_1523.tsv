$150	2	Arlington	August 2016	My place is close to AT&amp;T Stadium, The Ballpark at Arlington, Hurricane Harbor, Six Flags Over Texas, restaurants and dining, parks. Situated between Dallas and Ft Worth so you can quickly get to those cities. This second floor unit is in a safe, quiet, gated community. Good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). Pack&amp;Play crib and toys available upon request. It's a super clean, hotel suite experience. You can't beat this location if your visiting DFW!	32.7654975666738	-97.0935740744268	MINUTES FROM SO MANY ATTRACTIONS	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14715576?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
