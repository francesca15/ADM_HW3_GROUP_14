$299	2	Austin	June 2016	Located in the heart of down town Austin. My place is within walking to 6th St, ACL Live at The Moody Theater, Violet Crown Cinema, Easy Tiger, La Condesa and blocks of Rainey St. Youâ€™ll love staying at my Railyard condo because of the kitchen, coziness, high ceilings and especially the location. You can walk to just about everything downtown. It is great for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Parking is a premium downtown and my condo includes parking for one vehicle!	30.2649987038122	-97.74260592299679	Heart of the City, Beautiful Condo Downtown Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16085848?location=Austin%2C%20TX
