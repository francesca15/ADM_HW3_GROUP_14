$50	1	Buda	September 2016	My place is close to the city center, only 20 minutes from Austin and about an hour from San Antonio, art and culture, restaurants and dining. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location. Easy on / off the main highway and toll road. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).   You'll also get some fresh, delicious, home made, vegan English muffins made by me :-).	30.0767696004285	-97.81334260941071	20 min from DT Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15257366?location=Buda%2C%20TX
