$250	3	San Leon	July 2016	This perfect waterfront bayhouse has been family-kept since the 1940s. Fully re-built in 2009 after Ike, it is a great location for a fishing weekend. Front family room with multiple couches, and a futon; large dining room, and kitchen. The back rooms includes 4 beds; Two Pristine bathrooms inside, along with one inside and one outside shower. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the views and the location. My place is good for couples, families (with kids), big groups, and furry friends (pets).	29.489968854384305	-94.9119544717159	Quiet Family Bayhouse with Great Fishing Pier	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14160953?location=Beach%20City%2C%20TX
