$275	2	Horseshoe Bay	July 2016	Soak in the waterfront view while you drink your coffee each morning. Spend the afternoon lounging, fishing, swimming or take out your boat from the private dock. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the coziness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	30.5505924590157	-98.35687266550471	Lake Front, Lighthouse View	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13997136?location=Burnet%2C%20TX
