$140	2	Dallas	February 2014	My place is close to the downtown, art and culture, great views, and the adorable bishop arts. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location, the neighborhood, and the outdoors space. Walking distance to bars and night life. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	32.7579213494518	-96.8294984320104	Bishop Arts Home with Big Backyard	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17026364?location=Cedar%20Hill%2C%20TX
