$100	3	Bryan	March 2016	Get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and relax on the old family farm. The little pampered mobile home is not fancy but it's oh so peaceful and relaxing to sit by the pond or just relax on the big deck and view the hundred year old farmstead. Drive past the hosts house about 1500' down a maintained dirt road and you're there! You'll have your own campfire site complete with firewood and stumps to sit on!	30.7870843075792	-96.26493234828001	Country Hide Away sleeps 5	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12051444?location=Bryan%2C%20TX
