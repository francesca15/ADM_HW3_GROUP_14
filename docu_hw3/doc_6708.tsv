$100	3	Houston	July 2016	My spacious yet cozy home is great for families and kids. Lots of toys and games will keep the little ones busy if you prefer to stay indoor. If you don't mind the summer heat, fully fenced backyard with a swing set is a great place to have breakfast or to spend an afternoon. The house is less then 5 minutes from Hobby airport, 15 min. to downtown, 20 min. to the gorgeous Hermann park and the zoo, 30 min. to NASA and less than an hour from Gulf of Mexico (Galveston beach).	29.661043172019202	-95.27935671074052	Little kids' heaven with great backyard	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17187375?location=Channelview%2C%20TX
