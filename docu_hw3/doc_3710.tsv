$70	2	Conroe	November 2016	My place is close to The Woodlands, TX. Youâ€™ll love it because of the location. The Woodlands is 10 min. away! You can enjoy all the amenities of the Woodlands Waterway, Mall, and Market Street. Also, Houston is still within a 30 min. drive. My place is good for couples, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	30.150290343357202	-95.4021008527618	Woodlands Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16896098?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
