$140	1	Smithville	January 2016	The little house is nestled in the historic neighborhood of Smithville, one of the few thriving but untarnished small towns in central Texas. It's beautiful live oak and pecan tree lined streets are peaceful and perfect for taking walks just wandering thru the neighborhood or making your way to Main Street where you will find many small and delightful businesses. One of the exciting things about the little house is its close proximity to Round Top Texas and Warrenton Texas Antique Market	30.0088039632515	-97.1632885810057	Little House in Smithville	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14899869?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
