$50	1	Denton	November 2015	Great living area for resting and relaxing. Quite and friendly suburban neighborhood. Very nice home in suburbia Denton. I have pets but they are very friendly and inviting. If you are uncomfortable with dogs I can place them in their kennel during your stay. The room you would be staying in is very accommodating for travelers. There is a work space and 55' inch smart TV.	33.142777967913105	-97.11351915476601	Super quite, comfortable, relaxing, and inviting.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9554993?location=Corinth%2C%20TX
