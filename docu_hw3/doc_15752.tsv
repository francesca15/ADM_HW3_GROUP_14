$45	1	McKinney	August 2014	I'm offering two rooms for the price of one; plus a private bathroom. One room features a queen-size bed, and the other room has a sleeper sofa and tv. I am located less than 3 miles away from the historical Third Monday Trade Days in McKinney; perfect place to stay if you'd like to enjoy a weekend of shopping! And I'm less than 2 miles away from the Baylor Medical Center; I'm open to longer stays to accommodate an extended medical emergency.	33.2375403002165	-96.6834241984911	Two Rooms for the Price of One!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13495220?location=Anna%2C%20TX
