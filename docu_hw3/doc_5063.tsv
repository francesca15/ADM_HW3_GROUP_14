$169	4	San Antonio	August 2016	Hotel luxury with the comforts of home. Great location, near airport and easy to get to major highways, yet tucked away in a quiet and gated neighborhood. The house is next door to a wooded area of a city park and will likely see many deer. There is also a green belt behind the house where you will see deer also.	29.563310012699	-98.4399027496169	Vacation Home Away From Home close to Airport	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18312783?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
