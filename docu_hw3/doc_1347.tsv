$54	1	Austin	September 2015	Our home is located on a quite location right next to a park which has trails, playground and tennis court. It's also minutes away from restaurants, entertainments and major shopping areas. Since my home is on a brand new street and it doesn't show up on the map yet, so the address listed on this page is a proximate location. I will provide the exact address once you book my place.	30.4522578472057	-97.7825786551719	Cozy home on convenient location	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16611247?location=Austin%2C%20TX
