$201	4	Austin	March 2017	My place is close to parks and restaurants and dining. You can walk to the grocery store, Starbucks, and a couple restaurants and bars. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the privacy and easy drive to downtown and the chill backyard with hammock, BBQ, and trampoline. My place is good for business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups. **Note: my friendly cat Hondo will be home. You can basically ignore him, but if you are allergic this may not be the best home for you**	30.2051582082483	-97.8782894974444	4 BR Home 20 Minutes to Downtown or Hill Country	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17499008?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
