$129	3	San Antonio	May 2011	Cute three bedroom house in Alamo Heights area (AHISD). It is near the Quarry and Northstar Mall for shopping, and close to the Airport and the Zoo.   It has two full baths, including one in the master bedroom. We put in a nice deck and table in the backyard making it great on nice evenings (or days if Texas is not too hot). The neighborhood and the street are also quiet.  We have also installed a new kitchen and updated the baths.   This is the house my family stays in when we visit relatives, so we hope that it makes others feel at home.  This house is well suited for 6 people, however, if you have a larger party, please contact us beforehand.  Please no parties and no pets.	29.503181013035604	-98.46893887679491	Cute House in Alamo Heights Area	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/109393?location=Converse%2C%20TX
