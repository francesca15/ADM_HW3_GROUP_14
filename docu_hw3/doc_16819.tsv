$50	1	Dallas	May 2016	My place is close to many parks and trails. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the light, the comfy bed, the coziness, the high ceilings, the kitchen and the patio by the creek. The Magic House is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).  You never have to wait for your host. Our key-less entry allows you to eliminate physical keys entirely and instead enjoy the simplicity of key-less entry. Options include keypad models with a unique PIN assigned to you.	32.8953828731677	-96.72543569626231	The Magic House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13913446?location=Allen%2C%20TX
