$100	1	Austin	May 2012	Visiting the Texas Hill Country for a wedding or other event? Stay with us instead of at a hotel chain. Our place sits on four acres of beautiful woods, has a pool you can use, and we’re near a lot of wineries, breweries, distilleries, and other fun event sites. We’re about 20 minutes to south Austin and 25 from the airport.  You’ll be staying with three easygoing, friendly people who will leave you alone as much as you desire. We also have a dog and two cats—all friendly.	30.2298245857977	-98.0036209642221	Beautiful Hill Country Retreat Close to Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18808330?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
