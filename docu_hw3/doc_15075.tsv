$139	1	Freeport	June 2015	My place is good for couples and solo adventurers. The house is in a quiet waterside community so not suitable for loud, party-types or children or pets please. We will offer our guests a nice, casual comfortable place to relax and enjoy the coast. Bringing a boat? launch area is right across from the house and you can tie-up out front. Beaches are close by. Join us (if you'd like) for dinner Friday night, light breakfast Saturday and full cooked breakfast on Sunday morning.	28.963920109847898	-95.2925091219802	Ma√±ana Cabana coastal canal waterfront house	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17457189?location=Angleton%2C%20TX
