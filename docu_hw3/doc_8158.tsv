$25	1	Bryan	February 2017	My place is close to the airport, the city center, campus, downtown Bryan, Kyle Field, and only an hour and half drive away from Houston. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location, the neighborhood, and the people. It is a smoke-free and pet free place and it is good for couples, solo adventurers, students and business travelers.	30.622964791275898	-96.3553353871027	Cozy Private Room and Bath	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17343729?location=Caldwell%2C%20TX
