$45	1	Saginaw	September 2015	Private bedroom with queen size bed and private bathroom. Cable TV in room.  Living room with cable TV, dining room, kitchen, outdoor patio with grill and sitting area, free wifi, laundry room with washer and dryer  Brad and I work Monday through Friday 8am-5pm and my daughter is in school. We typically leave the house around 7:30am and return around 6pm. Guests will be able to reach me by cell phone if they need anything. I will make every effort to meet guests upon arrival.  We do have the worlds best dog, Scout. She is beyond friendly and never meets a stranger. She will most likely lay on her back for you to rub her belly as soon as you walk in the door. We keep her clean and shaved regularly. I can't stand a house that smalls like a dog so rest assured mine does not. :-)  Located next to: Willow Creek Park- jogging trail, volleyball, basketball, disc golf, dog park, playground  Close to: Historic Fort Worth Stockyards,  Fort Worth Botanic Gardens, 7th street Cultural District, Downtown Fort Worth  Uber is the best transportation available. If I am available I would be happy to show you around.	32.8527623364869	-97.37723606446458	1 Bedroom in quiet neighborhood	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8305468?location=Colleyville%2C%20TX
