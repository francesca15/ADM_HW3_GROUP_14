$70	1	Dallas	January 2014	My arty, light-hearted house is on a large wooded lot in a park-like setting, two short blocks from White Rock Lake and the Dallas Arboretum. Hike and bike trail is a jogger or cyclist's dream! Ten minutes to downtown or to Lower Greenvilleâ€™s nightlife with interesting shops and restaurants. Large country kitchen for fun cooking! Redwood hot tub on a big outdoor deck. Your furnished bedroom and private bathroom is at the end of its own wing with a huge shower and stained glass window.	32.823616430661694	-96.71449931607941	White Rock Lake Rustic Hideaway!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14772239?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
