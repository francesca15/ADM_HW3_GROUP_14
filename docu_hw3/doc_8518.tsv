$250	3	Austin	August 2016	This location is perfectly situated between shopping centers and cool Austin bars . It's close to IH-35 and it's a straight shot down one street to downtown . Hungry late at night ? Favor or Postmates can come deliver anything you like :) Lyft Uber or my favorite rideshare is about a 6 dollar fee to downtown . If I'm here and available I won't mind driving you either :)	30.1749059925337	-97.79945858423149	Perfect ATX location	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19024293?location=Buda%2C%20TX
