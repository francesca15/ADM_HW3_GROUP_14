$40	1	Austin	September 2016	Youâ€™ll love my place; clean, nicely decorated, quiet neighborhood. I am close to the Austin Airport, the COTA F1 Race Track, and an easy drive to the Downtown Austin Music Scene. My place is good for couples.	30.2284023037492	-97.58926545066929	Lannie's Place Bedroom 1	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15281219?location=Cedar%20Creek%2C%20TX
