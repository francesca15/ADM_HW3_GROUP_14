$29	1	San Antonio	May 2012	I have lived here only a short time and am having fun decorating the space. The home was built in the 1940s but has been updated with Open Floor Plan and High Ceilings. Basic, clean bedrooms with a queen sized bed and closet space. Conveniently located near 10 freeway and two blocks from bus line that takes you downtown in about 15 minutes.	29.4650716333213	-98.5114679485069	Casa Rodriguez-Close to Dwntwn/Tobin Hill/Pearl #1	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18688905?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
