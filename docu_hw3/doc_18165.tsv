$88	2	McKinney	February 2016	One of a kind cool country cottage, secluded yet minutes to McKinney &amp; Frisco for easy access to shopping and restaurants. Situated high on a hill overlooking 57 acres of beauty that is bounded by the east fork of the Trinity River. The cottage is next door to what was the main home but they are completely detached for privacy. Within miles of many wedding venues, makes this perfect for guests or even the bride &amp; groom's first night before honeymoon travel. We live nearby for quick attention.	33.3162571363299	-96.62819482321699	Stunning Country Cottage - Modern Jewel	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10996724?location=Anna%2C%20TX
