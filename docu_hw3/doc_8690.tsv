$41	1	Austin	October 2016	My place is close to nightlife and public transport. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, the location, and the people. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, groups, families and business travelers. I also have an air mattress that would be good for two more people.	30.163865647986196	-97.8274421947129	Beautiful, cozy private room in Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15346787?location=Buda%2C%20TX
