$300	6	Bee Cave	May 2016	My place is close to Austin, Texas. I live in the heart of hill country TX. My house is in one of the most upscale neighborhoods. Its safe and quiet. Also the location is amazing. You are walking distance to many amenities including restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping. Downtown Austin is only 17 minutes away so you can enjoy the city without the traffic. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	30.3051402170014	-97.9268193644854	Peaceful and huge estate with guest house and pool	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13165559?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
