$159	2	Fort Worth	April 2016	My place is great for business travelers needing a relaxing home after work and tourists who want to enjoy Fort Worth's gems, like the Kimbell Museum in the Museum District, TCU, The Stockyards, West 7th St. and Magnolia Street. We are within walking distance to Central Market and other great dining options. Arlington, with Six Flags, the Rangers and the Cowboys, is just down the road. We have a welcoming front porch and an outdoor dining table, a pool table, darts, ROKU and SlingTV.	32.7320914077489	-97.3779722365415	Comfortable Home in a Perfect Location!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12760577?location=Azle%2C%20TX
