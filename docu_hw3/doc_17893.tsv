$379	3	Corpus Christi	September 2016	My place is close to the Beach and Schlitterbahn. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the cleanliness of a freshly built and cozy brand new Townhome and it is located in a centralized area on the island putting it close to everything. My place is good for couples, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	27.6067707091101	-97.22476185115428	Nemo Cay Resort Townhome	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15085277?location=Aransas%20Pass%2C%20TX
