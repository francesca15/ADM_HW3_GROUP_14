$50	1	Irving	September 2016	Hi, I am renting my extra bedroom here. You will not get a hotel experience, but you will feel like your own home. I am a very easy going person and will try my best to give you the best airbnb experience. I am only 10 mins away from DFW airport. I have kept the description minimal so that your expectation is lower, but I promise you wont be disappointed. Come and explore. Ask me any questions or concerns. Thanks for looking.	32.8480010890182	-97.00319208743531	Queen bed close to dfw, Irving	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17668140?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
