$200	2	Pipe Creek	January 2017	This cozy country cottage on the Medina River is perfect for couples or families who want to escape from the hustle bustle of the city. Located in a quiet neighborhood just steps away from the river where you can spend your day tubing, swimming, fishing or just relaxing. There is a large tree covered patio great for BBQing and watching wildlife. The two bedroom 1 bath home will sleep six comfortably, 8 if some are on a pallet in the living room. 8 is max, doable but less comfortable.	29.677397292227504	-98.9766205372437	Medina River Cabins - Bandera Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16602607?location=Center%20Point%2C%20TX
