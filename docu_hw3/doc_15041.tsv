$43	1	Dallas	November 2013	Located in the Knox/Henderson area of Dallas, my house is walking distance from restaurants, nightlife, and public transportation. It is also only a short ride from Uptown, the Arts District, Deep Ellum, Bishop Arts, and Downtown.   People love my home because they find all of the amenities necessary to feel comfortable. I've also decorated the walls with photos of my travels in the U.S. and abroad, and I have a 30-pound lovable dog.	32.8143583584814	-96.7821613364085	Central Location + Walkable Neighborhood	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14048013?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
