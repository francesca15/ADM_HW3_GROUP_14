$140	3	San Augustine	March 2016	COME TAKE A STEP BACK IN TIME AND ESCAPE FROM THE WORLD A LITTLE WHILE!! This log cabin style rustic lodge is made from rough sawn long leaf pine trees fell by my uncle's own hands !! My family built this house with hand hewn beams squared most often using just a broad axe - transforming round tree trunks into square beams. This old-fashioned process is what gives hand hewn beams their trademark roughness and left this lodge with it's sense of simpler times ! (BUT WITH A HOT TUB NOW !!!)	31.3711806663029	-94.29568360703041	Forest Family Retreat and Sam Raybun Fishing Lodge	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15936588?location=Center%2C%20TX
