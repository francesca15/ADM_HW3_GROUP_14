$75	1	Terlingua	March 2015	This is a rebuilt ruin from the miners back in the 40's. I has a bed (futon), a light, and an outdoor area. This ruin is like a hard shelled tent, it is very rustic and special at the same time. It also has a small pot belly stove for cold nights, and a free standing AC. We request that you turn the AC off when away for the day. The ruin is located within the Ghost Town and within walking distance to restaurants and bars.	29.321207230310996	-103.611001835972	Ghost town Ruin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17495453?location=Big%20Bend%20National%20Park%2C%20TX
