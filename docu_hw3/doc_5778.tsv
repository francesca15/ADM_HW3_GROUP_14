$89	1	Cisco	June 2016	Built in 1925, this historic A-frame cabin is the last one of the total of 5 built on our property and the first one restored. These cabins have always been a great historic icon to Lake Cisco. We purchased this property February of 2016 with a goal of restoring the whole facility. Since the purchase, we have made lot of progress and will continue to move forward restoring &amp; modernizing the cabins! Our future plans also include having a store for bait, sporting goods and all your lakeside needs!	32.436911049378	-99.00331260633091	A-Frame #4 @ Lake Cisco Rentals	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13676230?location=Cisco%2C%20TX
