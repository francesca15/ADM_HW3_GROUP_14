$150	1	Sanger	May 2016	My place is close to restaurants and Winstar Casino. Sugar Ridge Winery is downstairs if you like wine. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the kitchen and the coziness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. You can enjoy all the comforts of home. This is great for a one night stay or a longer time. We can discuss a reduced rate for longer visits.	33.3614318658293	-97.1724599807122	Bed & Breakfast Located above Sugar Ridge Winery	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14221583?location=Aubrey%2C%20TX
