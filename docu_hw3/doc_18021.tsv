$299	4	Plano	July 2015	This is a wonderful comfortable home with everything you will need during your stay. It is the perfect place if you are coming for business, family vacation, or just to relax. It is not suited to large parties or events. My place is close to restaurants and dining and family-friendly activities. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location, the outdoors space, and the ambiance. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	33.0358297430196	-96.7500864729819	Spring SPECIAL!!!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15266170?location=Allen%2C%20TX
