$125	2	Bastrop	March 2017	Harmony House is situated on the beautiful Colorado River just two miles from downtown Bastrop. We've been told our property is Zen Central with its two acres of quiet meditative spots. Walk with ease to the water where you can partake in fishing, tubing, kayaking, swimming or just sitting and watching it all flow by. Birds and wildlife abound. We have built what we feel is the ultimate sanctuary to get away from it all. Breathe In, Breathe Out and let go!	30.0816184241503	-97.3309490113007	Harmony House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17664197?location=Cedar%20Creek%2C%20TX
