$22	1	Dallas	November 2015	Sharing newly renovated apartment, north west of downtown Dallas. It's about 10 minutes from Dallas love field airport. 15-18 minutes from downtown.   I have a very comfortable Mainstays sleeper couch. I can also setup an air mattress for the additional guest.  Just so there is no confusion, the other bed in the picture is meant for additional guest. I sleep in my own room.	32.865387862470605	-96.86835325275379	Shared space in a minimalist apt	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15957461?location=Addison%2C%20TX
