$300	4	Horseshoe Bay	July 2016	Quiet, lush, scenic lakefront house in Horseshoe Bay. Close to golfing, boating, fishing, and the storied Texas Hill Country. Youâ€™ll love this beautiful, and brand new Tuscan style house nestled underneath giant Pecan trees. Direct access to the lake from the property with a built in dock, and a huge yard for festivities. Enjoy the outdoors on the giant covered patio with outdoor kitchen. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	30.5473595573239	-98.3828341992709	Waterfront Horseshoe Bay Home on Gorgeous Property	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13884833?location=Burnet%2C%20TX
