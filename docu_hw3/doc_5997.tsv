$500	2	Houston	March 2016	New construction beautifully furnished townhouse in East Downtown. Less than 3.5 miles from all Super Bowl festivities. Reliant Stadium, where the Super Bowl itself will take place, is only 11 miles away (note ALL official festivities will be downtown; ONLY the actual game itself is at the Stadium; any native Houstonian can explain you will want to hang out &amp; party downtown &amp; not near the Stadium). Centrally located near everything worth doing in Houston meaning this is not in the suburbs.	29.747451489505895	-95.3185232442493	LuxuryTownhouse East Downtown (Warehouse District)	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16963375?location=Channelview%2C%20TX
