$84	3	Austin	June 2010	If you'd enjoy a quiet place to relax after a busy 4th of July, SXSW, or ACL, this is the place for you. The neighborhood is quiet and full of big trees and lovely neighbors. The house is comfy and spacious, and the patio is delightful.	30.175922368070697	-97.80361227526951	Gnome Sweet Gnome!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/958198?location=Buda%2C%20TX
