$70	Studio	College Station	October 2015	Our guest casita brings the feel of a boutique hotel to College Station. The guest home bedroom was recently remodeled and the bathroom will soon follow. All of the amenities of College Station and Bryan are close at hand. Youâ€™ll love this casita because of the comfy bed, the coziness, the privacy,and the peacefulness. Step outside and listen to the water fountain found on the 6th green of the golf course. Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	30.5638920316744	-96.2315478304569	Boutique and Private Golf Course Casita	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14896350?location=College%20Station%2C%20TX
