$23	1	Temple	March 2016	My house is less than a mile from Scott and White Medical Center and less than two from McLane Children's. Quiet neighborhood and a beautiful backyard. Perfect for rotating students! A (well behaved) cat and dog live here as well.  Please note, the bed in this room is a Full sized bed, not a Queen. It's very roomy for one person, but a little bit of a squeeze for two!	31.0846193155272	-97.37507018884492	Cozy Bedroom with Private Bath near Hospital	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16220160?location=Belton%2C%20TX
