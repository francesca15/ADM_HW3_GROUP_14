$56	1	San Antonio	June 2011	Our vintage 32' Airstream International is our vacation home on wheels. When we aren't using it to travel around Texas, it sits comfortably in our driveway and even has its own sewer hook up. With running water, propane heat, air conditioning, fans, a water heater, a comfy bed, a microwave, wi-fi, 2 TVs, a DVD player, Firestick TV, a large closet, a gas range/oven, and all the kitchen essentials, you can hardly call it camping at all. The private bedroom has a queen size bed with a feather bed topper and a down comforter to keep you extra cozy on cold nights. The pull out couch becomes a smaller full size bed. Two children or one adult can sleep comfortably on this pull out. Nestled in the shade of ancient oak trees and a good distance from our main home, our guests will find both privacy and comfort. It is a great space for a single occupant seeking some peace and quiet, a couple seeking some alone time, travelers seeking great access to the city, or a family looking to save some money on a vacation. We can't promise you won't fall in love with Airstreams and become obsessed with finding one of your own. Please be advised that showering in a travel trailer is different than you may be accustomed to. You have to turn on the hot water about 10-20 minutes before use and you have about 10 minutes of hot water to get clean. I will leave explicit directions on how to use the shower so you can have a good experience during your stay.  We have been doing airbnb in our home and guesthouse for over 2 years. It has been a wonderful experience and we enjoy the stewardship of hosting guests from near and far. Many of our guests appreciate our extra attention to detail, helpful tips for sight seeing and experiencing San Antonio, and our closeness to downtown and the San Antonio Riverwalk. We are accessible to our guests when they want/need it, but give you plenty of privacy. Some guests don't see us at all during their stay. I have a seamless self-check in that allows you to arrive at whatever time is convenient for you. And with airbnb messaging, I can answer your questions as they arise and in a timely manner.   A bus picks up from one block away and drops you downtown or at the Pearl for $1.20. We are about 2 miles from downtown and 1.5 mi from the Riverwalk extension at the Pearl. Our neighborhood (Alta Vista) is full of majestic old homes, a gorgeous historic park with a library, tennis courts, and pool. The nearby Pearl Brewery hosts a Saturday farmer's market, a culinary institute, and a slew of great gourmet restaurants, coffee shops, book stores, and locally-owned boutiques.  During your stay, you have access to our spacious yard, patios, fire pit, and propane BBQ. Plus the undying affections of our cat Little Boy.
