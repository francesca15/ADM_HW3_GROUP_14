$95	1	Terlingua	March 2015	This is an older Argosy Trailer made by Airstream, it has a full bed and a twin bed. The shower does not work, however there are showers and a full bath in a separate utility building (communal) 10 feet away, along with a community outdoor kitchen. The views are incredible! Also, we are happy to offer cooking facilities, we ask that you clean your pots, pans, and dishes after using them.	29.3223503372984	-103.61124345887698	Argosy Trailer in the Ghost Town	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5577617?location=Big%20Bend%20National%20Park%2C%20TX
