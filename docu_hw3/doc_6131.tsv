$170	1	San Augustine	March 2016	You'll love the seclusion and peace out here !! My home is close to Lake Sam Rayburn and totally surrounded by the Angelina National Forest . Great for couples, solo adventurers, families (with kids), and big groups utilizing the guest cabin. Also a breathtaking wedding venue !! Hiking and hunting (in season only of course!!) right out your backdoor in the Angelina National Forest. Fishing and boat ramps just 5 minutes away in Lake Sam Rayburn. Sam Rayburn lake is the largest man made lake.	31.3715747689623	-94.2979848602776	Romantic Luxury in the Woods !!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14867160?location=Center%2C%20TX
