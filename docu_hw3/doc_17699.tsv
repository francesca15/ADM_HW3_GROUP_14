$50	1	Dallas	February 2015	Our place is close to dining in Addison (on Belt Line Rd.), shopping at the Galleria, and a great Mexican restaurant called Casa Navarro! We are about 30 minutes from anything you could want to do in Dallas. Youâ€™ll love our place because of the guest room, shared common spaces, and big back yard. Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	32.9040282448911	-96.86996727735821	Club Coral - Private Room in North Dallas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15335459?location=Addison%2C%20TX
