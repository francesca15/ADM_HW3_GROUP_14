$65	1	Alpine	October 2013	My place is sweet, simple, quiet, and fun. On the edge of town, there's a small shared yard with trees, a view out front of the western mountains, and a feel of the area's culture. I love my cozy nook, a home base, a refuge, a comfort zone of memories and fun things I've collected from near and far. Safe and quiet, buffered from the more intense train noise, it's a sweet spot. I'm excited for the chance to share my abode while I'm not there... get out and explore this amazing area!	30.3498191808636	-103.67075966288401	quirky cozy nook in the Big Bend	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15875191?location=Alpine%2C%20TX
