$51	1	Houston	December 2014	My place rocks! Montrose is the best part of town -- I'm near the museums and best bars and restaurants! Lots within walking distance! This is where you want to be!  MASTER SUITE with PRIVATE BATH in my 3 bed room, 3 story, 2,100 sq.ft. home. Your bed has a Temperpedic mattress &amp; top notch bedding! This is actually my room, so if you're booking it, I'm out of town. You're welcome to all common areas: dining, kitchen, living. I have an awesome cat (awesome reviews), so you must like cats!	29.734036657241504	-95.3896168666843	Townhome in the Heart of Montrose!
