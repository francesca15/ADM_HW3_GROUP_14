$35	1	Austin	March 2017	My place is close to downtown, The Arboretum and the super trendy Domain shopping/dining haven. Youâ€™ll love it here because of the location, the ambiance of my amazing back yard filled with chickens, turkeys and plenty of Old West vintage deco. Also, the neighborhood is an older, rustic community with great charm and character. You will be especially comfortable here if you are in the following category of travelers: couples solo adventurers business travelers	30.3804096736447	-97.6720292510087	Mama Felise's Chicken Ranch BnB	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17616608?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
