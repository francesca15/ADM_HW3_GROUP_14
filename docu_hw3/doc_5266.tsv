$60	1	College Station	November 2016	Cozy little place only 1.3 miles from Kyle Field. A great place to stay if you're in town for a few days. We're right in the middle of town and it's easy to get to the school. Only about 20 minutes from downtown Bryan as well, which is one of our favorite hangouts.	30.596283329341897	-96.32338015907341	House near Kyle Field.
