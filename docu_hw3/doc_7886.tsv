$199	3	San Antonio	June 2015	My place is close to Lackland AFB (BMT graduation), just 5 min! 20 min from downtown, 15 min to sea world, &amp; near lots of shopping &amp; restaurants to include a Wal-Mart Supercenter around the block. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the space to comfortably fit a large family, a fully equipped kitchen, homey feel, hotel perks, community pool/park, &amp; quiet/peaceful neighborhood. My place is good for families with kids (especially in b/n PCS's), business travelers (TDY's), vacations, &amp; big groups.	29.353156787810697	-98.64276807746019	Perfect BMT Graduation home to enjoy San Antonio!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13578049?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
