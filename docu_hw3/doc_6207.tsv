$23	1	Crowley	April 2017	Nice home in the suburb of Fort Worth, Texas. Nicely sized backyard . Only about a 20-25 minute drive to Downtown Fort Worth. Town of all ages, with nice small things for kids throughout the week at the library or parks. Very cozy well kept place 10 minutes from old town Burleson, nice places to eat fairly near-by. Nice calm location, outside of the inner city limits.	32.5719121944527	-97.3797137587943	Private room with shared bathroom	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18407275?location=Cleburne%2C%20TX
