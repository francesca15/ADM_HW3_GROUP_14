$135	3	Llano	March 2016	Let me be honest, Haddox House is a 76-foot-long manufactured house that is ugly as sin when you drive up. BUT, it is super clean and comfortable, basically brand new, and has an awesome covered back patio overlooking the Llano River. You will love the river, the views, and the near constant breeze. It is close to the City of Llano, Enchanted Rock, Fredericksburg, LBJ Lake, and Lake Buchanan. It's a great getaway for couples, solo adventurers, and families with kids.	30.7240633981394	-98.8123772735915	Llano River Front With Huge Covered Patio	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17252293?location=Brady%2C%20TX
