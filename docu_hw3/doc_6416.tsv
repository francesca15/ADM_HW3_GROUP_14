$200	3	Industry	April 2014	Our place is a great getaway for couples, families (with kids) and big groups. It is perfect for a ladies weekend retreat to Round Top Festival or those that want a quiet place to relax and enjoy exploring the 140 acres or fishing in the stocked pond. You can enjoy an early cup of coffee or an evening cocktail on the back porch and watch the horses and cattle graze or keep a close eye for deer and other wildlife.	29.9799276306983	-96.46807912461979	Star G Ranch House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14662542?location=Chappell%20Hill%2C%20TX
