$74	1	San Antonio	April 2011	Youâ€™ll love my place because it is centrally located &amp; close to many of my favorite areas of San Antonio. It is approximately 7 min from the Pearl complex, 5 min to the St Mary's strip, the Quarry, Brackenridge Park, the Zoo, the Doseum, and 10 min from downtown. Olmos Park has much to offer as well with good restaurants, coffee, and shops. If you want to venture further away, my place is between the two major highways 10 &amp; 281. Lastly if you want to stay in, the property is quiet and relaxing.	29.467793164914198	-98.4876826378908	Quaint Olmos Park Condo Centrally Located	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7034685?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
