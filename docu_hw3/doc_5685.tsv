$650	1	Houston	January 2017	My place is close to Westheimer, City Center, I10, 59 &amp; the beltway. Youâ€™ll love my place because its spacious &amp; comfortable, a home away from home feeling tucked away from all the traffic Super Bowl weekend is sure to bring. Plus the bed is cozy, the kitchen is roomy, great for families or a girl/guy friends get-a-away. My place is good for couples and families (with kids).	29.719500296254502	-95.6499596533105	Super Bowl Ready!
