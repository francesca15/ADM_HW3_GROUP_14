$25	1	Universal City	December 2016	My husband and I have an extra private room in our house with a double bed and access to closet and drawers. The guest bathroom has been recently remodeled. Shared kitchen, fridge, and washer and dryer are available. We do have two cats for those who don't like pets or are allergic. My husband speaks German so German visitors are especially welcome.
