$375	3	Terlingua	March 2012	A quintessential Terlingua experience. The house is a 90-year-old ruin which I bought in 1996 and took 16 years to fix up into the eclectic home it is today. The floor-plan of the house keeps it comfortable year round. The views are unforgettable!	29.322848214829396	-103.61409495865101	Villa Terlingua, Stylish Main House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/671366?location=Big%20Bend%20National%20Park%2C%20TX
