$95	3	Buda	January 2017	Enjoy a private oasis with an incredible poolside view of the Austin city skyline. We're just south of the city, close enough to access amenities, but just removed enough for peace and relaxation. Explore nearly two acres of tree-filled land and a large pool and hot tub. Inside, we have beautiful views of the land from large windows, but cleverly positioned so you won't ever see a neighbor! There are high ceilings, a giant cozy couch, spacious kitchen and bedrooms.	30.1232148407131	-97.85715191806759	Private Getaway - Pool, Trees, and a View!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16782196?location=Buda%2C%20TX
