$150	2	South Padre Island	December 2015	My place is close to family-friendly activities and nightlife. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and families (with kids).  It is a short walk to the beautiful SPI beach and also a few steps from restaurants, clubs, kid and teen activities. Fun for everybody in the family!	26.101917812803002	-97.16702521456641	South Padre Island fun!!!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13281302?location=Brownsville%2C%20TX
