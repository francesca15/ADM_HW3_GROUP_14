$150	3	Arlington	March 2016	This house is just an Uber away from the cowboys, Rangers, 6 flags, the Highlands and the airport! The neighborhood is very laid back and a great place to relax. I recently moved to Dallas and i couldn't imagine letting go of my house. I decided to share it with travelers that are looking for a cozy home while away from home. I wouldn't expect guests to stay anywhere i wasn't willing to stay myself. I take great pride in my house and keep it clean and comfortable. Hope you enjoy your stay!	32.699416647863394	-97.0695910301165	House by stadiums, airport, 6flags!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11816805?location=Arlington%2C%20TX
