$111	1	Terlingua	August 2016	This is a romantic studio style cabin/house with a lofted bedroom in the second floor peek of the a-frame. This house offers privacy and solitude being that it is on a 10 acre piece of land on Terlingua Ranch with beautiful 360 degree views of the Christmas Mountains and Nine Point Mesa. I built this house as a creative space to make music and enjoy the Big Bend Region. The beautiful wooden porch with multiple hammocks and outdoor couch is great for watching sunsets. Molly is my co-host.	29.5556983124648	-103.4582511658	Casa de Creosote. Off-grid Cabin + RV and Camping	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16895505?location=Big%20Bend%20National%20Park%2C%20TX
