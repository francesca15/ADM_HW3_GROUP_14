$85	3	Cedar Park	August 2013	We are excited to open our beautiful home up to the Airbnb community! Ideally located with easy access to all North Austin has to offer. Beautiful, safe neighborhood, direct access to the freeway and less than 30 minutes to downtown Austin. Plus we just completed a fresh remodel that will make you feel right at home.  There is a park and pool close by, as well as every different kind of restaurant, we have written out our favorites for when you arrive!  Great kitchen with brand new appliances.	30.5201769539998	-97.819420511668	Brand new renovation, clean, comfortable home NxNW	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16621313?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
