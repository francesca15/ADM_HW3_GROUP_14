$24	1	Austin	September 2013	Our home is cozy, clean &amp; friendly. With the bus right outside the gated community, 2 pools, gyms, hot tubs and free parking, it's a great place to crash while exploring the city. Choose between the sofa bed or a bed in a private space. We love meeting our guest and sharing our home as well as our city.	30.1732797649954	-97.8025933311741	Pool, Gym & Bed in Gated Community	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13239834?location=Buda%2C%20TX
