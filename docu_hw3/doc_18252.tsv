$31	1	Addison	June 2017	Inside of Addison Circle, everything that you need is in short walking distance. Furthermore, a place in which you will not need a car, but very Uber friendly in getting around. Especially before Ka-Boom Town before the beginning of 3rd of July. Traffic can be horrendous. My lease is up in the beginning of December. If one needed an extended place to stay, I could discuss the terms on that as well, for I will be in the Atlanta, GA area shooting movies and television but available for you.	32.9624857614052	-96.8281793026041	Addison Circle Studio Available for Short Term	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19205954?location=Addison%2C%20TX
