$250	2	Jamaica Beach	April 2014	Stay for a visit at Bahama Way on the Bay in lovely Jamaica Beach, Texas! Have a little one, but not looking forward to lugging all your baby essentials? This refreshing and relaxing getaway has everything you and your family need. Located on the West End of Galveston, it’s the perfect combination of still canal waters and close access to a nice little beach across the neighborhood entrance. Nestled in what’s known as the “pregnant canal” there is plenty of water to enjoy fishing or swimming. A beautiful view from both upstairs and downstairs patios.	29.1916357995693	-94.98023454101249	Bahama Way on the Bay - Family Oasis!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16462013?location=Bayou%20Vista%2C%20TX
