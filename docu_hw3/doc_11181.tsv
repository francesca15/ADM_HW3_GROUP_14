$800	3	Del Valle	November 2012	Our modest country home sits on 2.2 acres, just 5 miles from the Circuit of Americas, 10 min. from ABIA, and 25 minutes to downtown Austin. We would be happy to accommodate your group during your stay for Austins many events and festivals.    This location offers the laid-back Austin attitude, with the respect and hospitality all humans can appreciate. We work steadily to manifest our land into a self-sustained homestead with organic offerings to share with our guests including fresh daily eggs, vegetables, fruit and herbs, and soon working toward fresh goat cheese and honey. Currently we have goats, chickens, honey bees, and surrounding horses and cattle. Our 4 dogs are all very friendly, but can be relocated during our stay. Also, we will have the house professionally cleaned to ensure your comfort.    Our latest lifestyle enhancement is a double-hopper frozen Margarita machine that can be used for a variety of frozen drink ideas, available to your group during your stay, and can be waiting for you upon arrival!    The house offers a very open layout with a large fully-equipped kitchen, and vintage parquet flooring that connects the dining and living room with open floor plan. Amenities includes cable TV, WIFI, whole-house water filtration, laundry, and of course the Freeze Machine for refreshments on the stone patio.     The master-room is big with a new foam king-size mattress and its own bathroom. GR#1 has a memory-foam queen-size mattress, and two sunny windows. GR#2, our nursery, can be offered as is to accommodate children, or can have a queen-size sleep setup.     Our property is entirely fenced in with a gate for privacy and security; the driveway has plenty of space for parking, and there will be be atleast one space in the garage.     I WILL ACT AS YOUR HOST during your stay, staying in a fenced off area on the back side of the house, away from your space. Responsible, well-intentioned entertaining by your party is encouraged. I can offer transportation between the airport, the racetrack, and any trips into Austin at fair transportation rates. Also, I can buy in advance any food, beverage, or entertainment needs that will suit your group. I am a hard-working member of the Austin community, and have many recommendations to offer to help you get the most of your Austin experience!    Feel free to leave me a message with questions or offers.     Come be our first quests and experience what we've been working so hard to create for our family!  	30.1713084206738	-97.6376634987727	Organic homestead 5 miles from F1	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/777071?location=Cedar%20Creek%2C%20TX
