$379	3	Corpus Christi	September 2016	My place is close to the beach and Shlitterbahn, centralized on the Island so everything is close by. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness even though it is a large town home. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	27.6045071392292	-97.2247240889274	Nemo Cay Resort Townhomes	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15147287?location=Aransas%20Pass%2C%20TX
