$61	Studio	Dallas	June 2015	This spacious studio apartment is located just south of downtown Dallas in an up-and-coming area, called The Cedars. As far as my space goes, the space has all updated appliances, A/C, both a W/D within, and more. The vibe is very relaxed with a lot of natural light. The location is ideal for anyone looking to stay in Dallas, but not right in the middle of downtown/uptown. A 5-10 minute Uber drive will get you anywhere you need to go in the area, and the complex is very safe.	32.768555833221896	-96.7975308897839	Cedars Studio Getaway	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18699544?location=Cedar%20Hill%2C%20TX
