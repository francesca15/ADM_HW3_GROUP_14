$189	2	Corpus Christi	January 2016	My place is close to restaurants, fishing, beaches, kiteboarding, &amp; bird watching. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, it's at the end of the road, the soothing bay breezes, and the immersion into nature. The place is great for kids to fish and crab so get ready to escape to our 2BR/2BA Laguna Madre Bayhouse, which has the best sunrises &amp; sunsets in the coast! Most of your time is going to be spent hanging out on our great front porch overlooking the Laguna Madre or on our 330' pier.	27.6148694891291	-97.2973589200651	Laguna Madre Bayhouse-Great for Anglers & Families	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10732781?location=Aransas%20Pass%2C%20TX
