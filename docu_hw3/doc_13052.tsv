$150	1	Galveston	March 2017	My place is close to great views, restaurants and dining, the beach, family-friendly activities just steps away....parades pass right in front for Mardi Gras and July 4th.. Youâ€™ll love my place because neighborhood is quiet, the coziness, the light, the peacefulness is best.. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). Great for bringing your bikes, but there's a bike and surrey rental just across the street just in case!	29.2787169302671	-94.80938952082519	"Kwik Kabana ""Where the Beach Counts"""	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17640239?location=Bayou%20Vista%2C%20TX
