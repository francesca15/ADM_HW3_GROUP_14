$40	1	San Antonio	April 2014	2 story house in a family neighborhood. 8-10 minute drive to Lackland Air Force base. Less than half a mile to 1604 on ramp and about 5 minutes from 410 loop. Close to fun like movie theaters, bowling alleys, and restaurants. It costs about 18 bucks to get into the center of downtown in an Uber! Great location for family or young folks. We love conversing and meeting guests especially over breakfast and mimosas, however we don't mind giving space and just being here for things you need!	29.4925685355735	-98.68659641325719	Cute cozy bedroom while visiting San Antonio!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19527496?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
