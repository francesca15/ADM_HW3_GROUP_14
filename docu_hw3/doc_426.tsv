$169	4	Spring	June 2015	Close to major highways! Covered patio with a Weber grill! Backyard with a trampoline and swing set for any kids you might bring along. An overall family friendly house or just a great crib for you and your mates. With smart use of the common areas more people can sleep. (hence, accommodates 12, maybe even more.) I'm also close to one of the Houston areas great malls, The Woodlands mall. Groceries stores very close as well. Book with me for a great experience. ***This is my personal home***	30.079483151111603	-95.39830172306542	Home away from Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15965045?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
