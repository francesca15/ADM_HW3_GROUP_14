$1000	5	Porter	July 2013	Close to the action but away from the busy city. Our new home is 25min to downtown and only 15 min to IAH. You can enjoy the outdoor patio which overlooks a little lake. Our five bedrooms and spacious family rooms offer plenty of sleeping areas. Your favorite time might be spent in the media room where you can stream movies! It would make for a wonderful Super Bowl weekend.	30.0770089042458	-95.2185527214705	Weekend in Suburbia!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16663458?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
