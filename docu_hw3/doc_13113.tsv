$250	3	Galveston	June 2013	We love being so close to the beach because we can walk back to the house any time, for anything.  Built in 1925, our 3 bedroom cottage has been recently remodeled in a very unique Modern Vintage style. The backyard is beautifully landscaped with tropical plants, walkways and a large palapa with chairs to enjoy the evening breezes or morning coffee. We've added outdoor showers for washing off when you come in from the beach.	29.2840325485088	-94.7964216499315	Tropical Craftsman Bungalow 1/2 Block to Beach	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12366166?location=Bayou%20Vista%2C%20TX
