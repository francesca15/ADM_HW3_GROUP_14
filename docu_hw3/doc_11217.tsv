$175	2	San Antonio	November 2016	The Hobbit House is a cute and cozy home, very close to family-friendly activities like Sea World, Fiesta Texas, La Cantera Shopping and Restaurants . Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood, the peacefulness and open skies. We share with you indoor and outdoor blue-tooth radio and games (Ladderball, horse shoes, frizz-bee, dominoes, cards and football) and not to mention our amazing outdoor area to BBQ and listen to some music under the illuminating lights.	29.4474158528182	-98.72905547207769	The Hobbit House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16175671?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
