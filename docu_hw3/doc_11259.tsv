$90	3	San Antonio	March 2016	Built this house next to mine for my ailing dad and it is still very new. This peaceful house sits on our 1.2 acre property. Every day 50+ deer stroll by as they live in the neighborhood. We are the closest option to the bustling medical center.	29.4982165702171	-98.58270286433691	Peaceful, Hidden, Medical, Central	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12884274?location=Bulverde%2C%20TX
