$33	1	Denton	February 2016	I am renting out my garage out. There is a comfortable couch and there is no AC or bathroom/sink. There are plenty of wall sockets to use. There is a big screen TV with no antenna. A portable AC unit will most likely be provided.  You'll have access to my house to use the facilities, laundry room and kitchen only.	33.2218999662507	-97.14374477671291	Crash pad in garage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/11253160?location=Argyle%2C%20TX
