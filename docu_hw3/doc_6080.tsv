$85	1	Katy	September 2015	My place is one of the most beautiful places in Houston Tx. It has everything that you would need and want in a place. We have a state of the art pool area and workout room. My place is family friendly and it's perfect for one person. It's a luxury condo and the neighborhood is amazing. It's a gated community. Walmart, Kroger and other stores and restaurants are nearby. This is my place so I treat it like a kingdom. It will be fully furnished and ready to go soon. The parking is great.	29.7897295367462	-95.7296736853964	The District at Westborough	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19554436?location=Cinco%20Ranch%2C%20TX
