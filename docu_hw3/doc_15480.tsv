$109	Studio	McKinney	February 2016	My downstairs efficiency apartment is close to old downtown McKinney near Highway 75, 5 and 380. Youâ€™ll love my place because it is newly updated and professionally designed. It is light, white and and neat as a pin. It has a private patio of pink crushed granite with furniture and flowers for fun in the fresh air. We have a beautiful treed backyard. Neat Suite is just a short hop to old downtown Mckinney where you'll find lots of non-chain restaurants, bars, antique shops and laundromat close.	33.2089765702426	-96.6191573339102	Neat Suite	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16573953?location=Anna%2C%20TX
