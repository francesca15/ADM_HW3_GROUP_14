$63	1	Houston	January 2016	Three lights away from Downtown, youâ€™ll love the location. Great for couples, solo adventurers and furry friends (pets). A neighborhood away from The Heights, a must visit area. A block away from the Metro Rail, which once on is a two train stop away from local bars and restaurants in Downtown. As well as easy access to three major highways within a three minute driving radius.	29.7804563964874	-95.3657279438176	Entire Apartment Near Downtown Houston	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16808594?location=Baytown%2C%20TX
