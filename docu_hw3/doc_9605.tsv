$37	1	Dallas	April 2016	Mid-century ranch tastefully appointed with mid-century furniture, located in a quiet residential area with access to neighborhood clubhouse with pool.  My place is close to Downtown, 5 miles from Love Field, 20 minutes from D/FW, nightlife, and public transport. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the neighborhood. It is quiet, yet also good for adventurers and business travelers because of easy and close access to all major freeways in the Dallas Metroplex.	32.8949295039901	-96.86206701896309	Private room and bath in N.
