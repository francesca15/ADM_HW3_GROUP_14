$295	3	Nemo	February 2017	Welcome to our piece of heaven. This 3 bedroom, 2080 square foot house is located just a few miles south east of Glen Rose, Texas. The County Road ends at our driveway. You can't get much more remote than this. So peaceful and quiet. If you want to get away from it all, this is your house.
