$38	1	Allen	May 2017	Large private home at the end of a cul-de-sac in Allen next to a pond with fountain. The walking and jogging trail next to the pond. Along the way you can sit down on the park bench and feed the ducks or look for turtles. Once home you can still view the pond and fountain from several rooms within the house and from the back yard. Close the doors on the Study downstairs and get some work done or just relax in the quiet and watch the wildlife outdoors in the pond.	33.0833495824365	-96.6230312548339	Safe, Private, Quiet, Comfy-Home Away From Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18808868?location=Allen%2C%20TX
