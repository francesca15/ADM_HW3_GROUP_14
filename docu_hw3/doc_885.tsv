$115	3	Fort Worth	August 2014	My place is close to restaurants and dining and family-friendly activities. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the comfy bed, the kitchen, the outdoors space, and the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). There are three bedrooms with two queen sized beds and a futon also queen size in the living room. If using the third room an inflatable mattress would be needed to sleep on. Hot tub is in working order and may be used!	32.8398741572678	-97.37100911176191	Entire Home with Beautiful Quarry Access	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14371280?location=Colleyville%2C%20TX
