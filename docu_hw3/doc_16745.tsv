$95	1	Richmond	May 2015	My place is close to Katy Mills Mall, Typhoon Texas Waterpark, and sits in the center of Katy's Fine Dining. You'll love my place because of the neighborhood and convenient location, also it's a newly built home. My home sits on the side of Westpark Tollway, which takes you into the city within 25 minutes. Also the tollway provides a straight shot to Houston's Galleria Mall. My home is a great fit for business travelers , Families (with kids), and big groups.	29.695610315615	-95.78158905158492	Tranquility room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16839345?location=Beasley%2C%20TX
