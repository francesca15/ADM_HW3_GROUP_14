$61	1	San Antonio	March 2016	My place is close to the downtown San Antonio, San Pedro Park, and restaurants and dining. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, original hardwood floors, and the high ceilings. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Close to the Pearl district and only 15 minute drive to the airport!	29.4571936380513	-98.5026718219508	Nice place between the airport and downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17745797?location=Bulverde%2C%20TX
