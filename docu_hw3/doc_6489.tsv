$125	1	Glen Rose	February 2016	Secluded gated stone house on 6 acres 5 minutes from downtown Glen Rose.   Originally built as a guest house but turned out so special the main house was never built.   Great for a couple, single person or a family of four just wanting to spend some quiet time in the country and still be close to everything.	32.2511330768798	-97.7735997962134	Our special place in the country!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19143867?location=Cleburne%2C%20TX
