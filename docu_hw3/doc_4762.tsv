$65	1	Carrollton	October 2014	My place is close to family-friendly activities. Youâ€™ll love the place because of the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets). I own a German Shepherd myself and i do dog training for a living so no doubt this guy is fully trained.  I am very eco-friendly so i am all about REuse, REduce and REcycle. Bedroom 12x11 closet, ensuit bathroom on a second floor, which gives you more privacy.
