$100	1	Grapevine	January 2017	My place is close to Lake Grapevine (1 block), Gaylord Texan (15 min walk), Historic downtown Grapevine (5 min drive), DFW airport (15 min drive), and downtown Dallas or Ft. Worth (30 min drive).  Youâ€™ll love my place because of the beautiful neighborhood with mature trees 1 block from Lake Grapevine &amp; Katy's Woods Parks. The 1 bedroom cottage is private and quiet. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	32.9560895712658	-97.06834767017281	Just a little somethin' - Cottage @ Lake Grapevine	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17477997?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
