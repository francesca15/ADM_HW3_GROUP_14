$38	1	Dallas	October 2016	My apartment is a cozy artist get away only a few minutes from nightlife, shopping and dinning in Deep Ellum, Lower Greenville, and downtown Dallas. Whole Foods, CVS, and Starbucks are right up the street! So is the Lakewood Public Library and the Santa Fe Trail that leads you right to White Rock Lake! Enjoy the glass doors that open to a balcony overseeing the beautiful and easily accessible pool! My home is a LGBTQ and people of color affirming space.	32.8085129339755	-96.7581887202232	The Plaza on Gaston	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19074820?location=Carrollton%2C%20TX
