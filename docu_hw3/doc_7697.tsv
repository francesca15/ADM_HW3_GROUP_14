$38	2	Austin	May 2016	My place is close to University Of Texas. Youâ€™ll love it because it has a great location on 22nd St and is located within a small four apartment complex in the quieter part of West Campus. There is also parking included, which can be hard to come by in Austin. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and big groups.	30.286911184504	-97.7514097516172	West Campus Fourplex, 2 full beds and one bathroom	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13265661?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
