$115	1	Bastrop	October 2015	The 10 acre property is an oasis right in the heart of Bastrop. There is private river access (shared with the neighbors and friends of the host) and down town is just across the river (10 min walk across the bridge). The large pavilion by the water is a peaceful setting day or night.	30.108182315819	-97.32408073224171	Little House on the River	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10253775?location=Bastrop%2C%20TX
