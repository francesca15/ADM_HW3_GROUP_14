$59	1	San Antonio	September 2016	Close enough to Downtown to be cool by association, Monte Vista's historic character sets it apart from its neighbor's highly trafficked path. Hole-in-the-wall bars, food truck parks, casual resturants, and one of the oldest parks in the US lend Monte Vista a classical, artistic edge. Set just minutes from downtown. Seriously, I've lived lots of places in San Antonio and this area is the best! If this space is booked, check out my other listing, I likely have availability.	29.454580988803702	-98.49647362331899	Entire Apartment in Historic Downtown	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15008867?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
