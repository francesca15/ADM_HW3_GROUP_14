$77	1	Austin	October 2013	Come enjoy our relaxing comfortable home adorned with a collection of Asian &amp; Egyptian decor. The amazingly high vaulted center ceiling &amp; interior atrium make it exceptionally unique. Great energy!   You can walk to the wooded park, enjoy outdoor shower, cozy up by the fireplace, or stroll over to the creek.   Tucked away from the hustle of city buzz, yet close enough to jump right in. 15 minutes from downtown, 10 min to any great shopping needs and the University area.	30.3294819721733	-97.64761801189371	BEAUTIFUL ZEN Hideaway	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5558744?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
