$79	2	Austin	January 2017	Make yourselves comfortable. This is essentially an affordable whole-home rental except the hosts share the front entrance. Our comfy home is on a quiet cul de sac close enough to enjoy all that Austin and the surrounding area has to offer but quiet enough to feel like a retreat with a Texas-sized backyard. We have 2 queen bed guestrooms plus a full-size LaZBoy sofabed in the living room to accommodate a 5th guest. My place is good for solo, couples, business travelers, or medium groups.	30.166110570828298	-97.77066469233058	Affordable Austin Staycation Retreat wBig Backyard	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16612833?location=Buda%2C%20TX
