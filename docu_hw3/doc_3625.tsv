Guests have access to kitchen and appliances. 2 spacious living areas, washer and dryer, backyard and guest bathroom.  I respect your time and privacy. If guests like interaction and conversation, I'm available, if not, I'll let you do your thing.  I enjoy the quiet and friendly neighbors I have. I love the location and access to shopping, eating and downtown.  We have close access to the city bus.
