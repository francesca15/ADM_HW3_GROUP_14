$30	1	Pflugerville	April 2017	My home is very minimalistic, quiet, clean, neat and comfortable. I'm frequently at work or traveling so the house is cleaned every other week by a maid service, but is maintained to be a relaxing environment where you can turn off. Our neighborhood is very peaceful and we're close to grocery stores, car washes, pharmacies, movie theaters and many restaurants.	30.470590682105698	-97.6371084241577	Private room w/bathroom is yours to rest easy.	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18121056?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
