$40	1	Pflugerville	September 2015	My home is located just north of the Austin city limits and a short drive from downtown Austin with easy access to I-35 and SH-130. I welcome guests looking to explore ATX, but would rather stay outside of downtown. A car is suggested for transportation.	30.392129675640696	-97.6152722707721	Private Bedroom outside Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9010824?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
