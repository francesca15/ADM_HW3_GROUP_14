$375	3	Seabrook	September 2016	This seaside home will be your private paradise, just minutes from the Kemah Boardwalk and NASA and only forty minutes from downtown Houston. We are walking distance from two quiet beaches. There are nearby parks with wooded hiking and jogging trails and play areas for children. This is also a great area for bird watching. There are many restaurants close by. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, small groups, and families with children.	29.597706564201697	-94.9888253318174	COZY SEASIDE HOME	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14892002?location=Bacliff%2C%20TX
