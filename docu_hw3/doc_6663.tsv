$112	1	Crawford	November 2016	Visit Gathering Oaks Retreat as part of a group or an individual looking for a bit of relaxation. Enjoy a weekend away from the city! We are located close enough to play and dine in town all day, and then escape to relax in the country. Hideaway king suite #5 also gives you access to take a dip in the cool pool and relax in all the common areas under the string lights and trees. Take a nature walk, lay by the pool, and unplug for a minute to enjoy a deep breath of fresh air. Wifi available.	31.5946512006229	-97.34087982442959	Hideaway Suite @GatheringOaksRetreat	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17443237?location=Clifton%2C%20TX
