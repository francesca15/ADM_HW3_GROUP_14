$140	1	Galveston	October 2016	Live like a local in our cozy condo. Enjoy the island and come home to a relaxing space with fully equipped kitchen, washer/dryer, comfy bed and more. Across the street from the sea wall with miles of sandy and secluded beaches. Or try your hand at the nearby fishing pier. Close to shopping centers (Walmart, Kroger's, Marshall's, more) and local eats. Want to take a break from the beach?
