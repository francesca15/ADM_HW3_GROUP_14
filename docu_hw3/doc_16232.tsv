$216	3	Houston	July 2016	Welcome to my newly remodeled (2016) cottage in the popular Woodland Heights area of Houston. The location is ideal for downtown, Minute Maid Park, the Arts District, the Washington Avenue/ White Oak entertainment areas with its restaurants and nightlife. Freeway access is a snap, so getting to your sports or shopping venue is easy. We stocked the kitchen with all you need to prepare a gourmet meal, or to just brew that fresh cup of coffee in the morning. This home is a rental only.	29.7856539636422	-95.37293714203942	Woodland Heights Home - Convenient, Modern, Fresh	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13798928?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
