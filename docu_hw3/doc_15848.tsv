$50	2	Kemah	February 2017	Great place for a weekend getaway either romantic or for a small party. My place is close to Nasa Space Center, Kemah Boardwalk, Clearlake, Galveston Bay, restaurants dining, and parks. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the coziness, the location, the views, and you will be rocked to sleep on the water. It is located in a beautiful resort style marina, with two pools, ample bbq and picnic areas, and two clubhouses. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and friends.	29.5409298469236	-95.04322454224899	Kemah Tropical Getaway Cabin on the Water!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17592781?location=Bacliff%2C%20TX
