$75	1	Denton	February 2016	Enjoy a private room with your own dedicated entrance right into your room. You also have access to an unshared bathroom complete with a tub if you enjoy soaking baths!  My home is close to TWU, UNT and the Denton square where you'll find many choices for lunching and dining. Directly across the street is a mexican grocer that serves made to order tacos, aguas frescas, daily made salsas and snacks.  The neighborhood has lots of mature, tall trees, perfect for enjoying a walk.	33.2355457824095	-97.1237809163722	Big room w/ private entrance and private bathroom	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14450478?location=Aubrey%2C%20TX
