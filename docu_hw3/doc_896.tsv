$795	6	Horseshoe Bay	August 2014	Youâ€™ll love our place in a very quiet neighborhood because of openness of the living area and great room, each guest room having own bath and the beautiful views of the water and sunsets from the back porch and the upper and lower decks. Good for couples, families (with kids), and big groups.   A relaxing get away with golf, water or just pure relaxation.  Our home is conveniently located near 5 golf courses in Horseshoe Bay. Golfers welcome for a relaxing stay during tournament weekends.	30.5575046544055	-98.39861940739429	Retreat to Horseshoe Bay!
