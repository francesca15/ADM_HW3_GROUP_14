$90	Studio	Lindale	March 2011	Great place to unwind/disconnect! Super cute and quaint private studio 25 min from Canton (first Monday's) or 15 to Mineola (a step back in time and fun antique shopping). This is a private separate upstairs apt from the main home located in the country with a small kitchenette and a small bathroom with shower. Very peaceful and relaxing setting. Excellent breakfast at request. Pets do live on our property however they have no access to the private apartment or the parking associated with it.	32.5690754971123	-95.5538580556396	Wisteria Pines Cottage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13016399?location=Alba%2C%20TX
