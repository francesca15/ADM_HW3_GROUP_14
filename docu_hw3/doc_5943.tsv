$135	2	Kingwood	January 2015	This peaceful and comfy home is a great place to relax with all the comforts of home. Enjoy the greenbelt system of 70+ miles of wooded trails for walking or cycling, stop by one of many family owned restaurants from a casual fresh bagel shop to fine dining on the waterfront. My Home is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. Lots of space to put my portacrib up in the Master. Could be child friendly on a case by cases basis but not for rambunctious children!	30.077299667816302	-95.1695975315873	Welcome Home to Adorable quiet Bungalow with 2B/2B	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12726566?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
