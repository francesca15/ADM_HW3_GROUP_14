$59	1	New Braunfels	August 2016	My spacious home is only a 5 minute drive from downtown and Schlitterbahn. Historic Gruene is a 10 minute drive. Use the gourmet kitchen or you can visit several great eateries close by. I have an extra room and air mattress for larger parties. My friendly cat, Scooter, will probably greet you before I do when you come in the door. The neighborhood is very quiet and the neighbors are extremely friendly.	29.663560707832104	-98.1559347838067	Comfy New Home with Private Bed and Shared Bath	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14536569?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
