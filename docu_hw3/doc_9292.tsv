$250	2	Fredericksburg	November 2016	Come spend some time enjoying the hill country and wineries while overnighting in a restored vintage camper. This is a great spot that is secluded and private yet only 2 miles from town. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the outdoor space and comfortability! This is a great stay over for couples, families, girls trip and solo adventurers. There are two vintage campers to stay in at the camp. Both of the trailers have a queen bed and bathroom. There is also a covered outdoor bathroom.	30.289033140516	-98.9027317035955	Barons Creek Camp	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16108011?location=Center%20Point%2C%20TX
