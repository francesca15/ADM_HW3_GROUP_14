$115	1	Carmine	June 2014	My place is very close to close to Round Top, Texas and Festival Hill. It has WIFI, Satellite TV, and comfortable rooms in a newly constructed classic farmhouse on a working farm. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers and a sitting room with a foldout sofa is available as an add on (upon request). Very close to many of the Antique Fair destinations!	30.1327554833226	-96.7084772941399	Cowboy Room in New Carmine Farmhouse	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14947912?location=Carmine%2C%20TX
