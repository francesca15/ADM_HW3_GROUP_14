$175	1	Round Top	April 2017	We've all seen Shipping Container homes, but how many of us can say we've actually stayed in one? Built from recycled shipping containers, these simply amazing, durable, iron boxes were once used to ship just about anything imaginable around the globe by land and sea.  Now, with a new lease on life, FLOPHOUZE has transformed these containers into unique, comfortable, cozy living spaces. Come Stay, you won't want to leave.  FlopHouze II sleeps 4 comfortably by offering two twin beds and a full size pull out couch. An efficient hollywood bathroom separates the space with an iron and hair dryer. Outside, each houze has its own firepit, hammock and chairs. Inside, the kitchenette features a sink, microwave, mini fridge, tea kettle and coffee maker for the morning get up an goers! The interiors are cladded with sustainably harvested wood from our farm in upstate New York and reclaimed lumber from a distillery in Kentucky. The windows were salvaged from a school in Philadelphia that was slated for demolition, and provide tons of natural light. On a playful note, we installed kitchen cabinet bases from an FDA laboratory in Brooklyn, and old bowling alley floors from Texas for the countertops! Upon your arrival, each houze will have complimentary coffee and tea, Topochico sparkling water, and Mexican Cokes. Just a short drive away in Round Top, there is a market for light snacks and other goodies. Every detail has been carefully crafted to ensure that your stay is a memorable one	30.0199721985528	-96.75545582270529	FlopHouze II -Round Top, TX	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18288757?location=Carmine%2C%20TX
