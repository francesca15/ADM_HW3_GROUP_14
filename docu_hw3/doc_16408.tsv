$109	1	Austin	May 2017	My home is on top of a hill overlooking downtown. For the time being (they are talking about moving soon) I am the first house to the left of the Hope Gallery which is one of the last remaining, sanctioned, graffiti parks in the country!  This home has a large, young, energetic dog and an adorable cat so if you have allergies or a fear of large animals, this might not be the space for you.	30.2750482460643	-97.7538372515672	Hip Hilltop Home in Downtown Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12916775?location=Austin%2C%20TX
