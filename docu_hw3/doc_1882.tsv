$40	1	Houston	July 2016	My place is a five minute drive from NRG Stadium. Close to Rice Village, a short drive from downtown, close to major freeways, walking distance to the bayou trails and other local parks. Bus stop is just a few blocks away. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the quiet location, but its close proximity to everything you want in the city. My place is good for solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).	29.684376140057804	-95.44205451715901	Minutes from NRG!
