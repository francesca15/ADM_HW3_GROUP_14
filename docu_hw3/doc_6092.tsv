$95	4	Cibolo	June 2016	Comfy, modest home in a quiet, middle class neighborhood. My home is great for families or groups that plan to spend time exploring San Antonio and the Texas Hill Country. Situated off of I35, you'll have an easy drive to Schlitterbahn and tubing the Comal River. For all your downtown sightseeing, you'll have an easy 35 minute drive. If Fiesta Texas and Seaworld are on your itinerary, you'll head to the West side of San Antonio, about 45 minutes away.	29.6007848760248	-98.2548668766668	Conveniently Located, Great for Families, 4b/2.5b	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17847819?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
