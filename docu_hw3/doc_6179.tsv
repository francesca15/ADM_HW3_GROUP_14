$249	3	Whitney	June 2016	My place is close to Uncle Gus Marina on Lake Whitney. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the views are spectacular. My place is good for couples, families (with kids), and big groups. We are located next to a cliff overlooking the water and have a separate entrance to be used when pulling a trailer.	31.8614784512776	-97.3847553700774	Sunrise & Sunset	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13543086?location=Clifton%2C%20TX
