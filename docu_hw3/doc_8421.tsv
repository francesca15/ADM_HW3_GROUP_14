$55	1	Columbus	April 2015	Hurry before the oven door opens and Texas gets too hot! lately the days have been warm and the nights are still cool enough to enjoy some star gazing in our big open field above the camp. If the weather does turn hot spend it on the shady banks of the creek and find a cool spot in the creek to soak in. Kick back drink some wine, eat some cheese and catch some rays. :)	29.7540058686981	-96.5254209756436	Camp on a private spring fed creek	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5954086?location=Cat%20Spring%2C%20TX
