$69	1	Terlingua	October 2016	My place is very very close to Big Bend State &amp; National Park, Ghostown Terlingua is only a mile drive, restaurants, family-friendly activities &amp; nightlife are all very close. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the uniqueness, comfort and privacy from big crowded camping areas, the complete covered outdoor kitchen, the comfy beds &amp; the high ceilings. My place is good for couples, adventurers, business travelers, families, big groups, and furry friends.	29.3944363658776	-103.66283612865699	Terlingua Ghostown Barndominium # 2	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17601978?location=Big%20Bend%20National%20Park%2C%20TX
