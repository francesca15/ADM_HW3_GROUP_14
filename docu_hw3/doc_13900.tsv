$35	1	La Porte	March 2016	Your room is freshly remodeled with new carpet, fresh texture and paint. The room has a satellite tv, bluray player, and alarm clock radio. A queen size super cozy bed and nice dresser with a walk-in closet. I also provide WiFi access. You may use the washer and dryer, and there is some space in the fridge. It's only 20 mins to NRG stadium or medical center. I do live in the home, as does my girlfriend. We are friendly and love to chat, but won't pester you. NO PETS, NO TOBACCO.	29.6621699369032	-95.10599038014351	Collingdale	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17058462?location=Beach%20City%2C%20TX
