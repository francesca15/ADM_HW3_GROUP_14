$65	2	San Antonio	July 2015	I hope youâ€™ll love my place because of the quiet ambiance and easy accessibility to San Antonio. My space is great for groups, families, couples, adventurers, and business travelers. Enjoy your time in a private house. You have access to the living room, kitchen and dining room, bonus room, two bedrooms, an office, and two and a half bathrooms. There is plenty of space for everyone! Best yet, the house is only 20 minutes from beautiful Downtown San Antonio/River Walk (it's a short uber ride!).	29.4653267855394	-98.35323424293291	House Nestled in Quiet Neighborhood	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18568735?location=Cibolo%2C%20TX
