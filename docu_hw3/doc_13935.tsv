$150	2	Rockport	July 2015	This central Rockport cottage is blocks away from shopping and the beach! The house is perfect for families or friend getaways! There are 2 bedrooms with queen size beds, 2 full baths, a large kitchen, and plenty of comfy couches to sleep extra bodies! The backyard is filled with fruit trees, a bar area, and several patio seating areas to relax or dine on. I do rent out a separate small back house that may be rented as well (sleeps 2 additional guests): https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14204396	28.020772500714397	-97.05233785797449	"""Proud Mary's"" Cottage downtown Heritage district"	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13972602?location=Bayside%2C%20TX
