$35	1	Humble	June 2015	Adventurers and those passing through welcome! My place is relaxed and the atmosphere is easygoing. Only 15-20 minutes from IAH. Happy to work out a pick up/drop off from airport. Dogs (and kids) are welcome to stay as well! They should list coffee under essentials but don't worry I've got you covered.   House includes a backyard and near some trails, a neighborhood Walmart, and Starbucks. Easy access to 59 for exploring other areas of Houston.  *Double listed for different availability	30.069125456936998	-95.20439454433858	Near IAH...Dogs, coffee, and trails!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16427580?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
