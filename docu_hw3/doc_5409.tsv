$139	1	Brenham	October 2014	Surrounded by trees, the Woodland Cottage is a private haven and a great country getaway. My place is just about 7 miles outside of Brenham, Texas where you will find great restaurants and shopping. A great escape from the Big City &amp; good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets). A fully functional kitchen is provided with a refrigerator, stove, and microwave.  A dining nook in front of a big picture window is a great place to linger over breakfast.	30.0889880906257	-96.4787336331396	The Woodland Cottage near Brenham, Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15024420?location=Chappell%20Hill%2C%20TX
