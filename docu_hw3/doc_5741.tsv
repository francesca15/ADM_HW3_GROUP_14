$950	4	Spring	January 2017	My place is close to restaurants and dining and family-friendly activities. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the people, the ambiance, the outdoors space, the light, and the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets). It is very accessible to major highways (the new Grandparkway/99 Loop is less than a mile away!) On weekends (i.e. Super Bowl) is an easy 30 minutes). The community is very safe and comfortable,virtually no crime at all.	30.133220429410702	-95.387730173781	Super Bowl Shangri La	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17000855?location=Cleveland%2C%20TX
