$49	1	San Antonio	September 2015	My best version of French country style. I hope you'll give the Beau of Broadwick a try. It is simply a clean house to stay while visiting or working in San Antonio. It is close to the Rackspace complex &amp; Randolph AFB. The townhome is approximately 884 square feet and on the Far Northeast Side of San Antonio.	29.506021552428397	-98.3534546867633	Beau of Broadwick	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16239292?location=Converse%2C%20TX
