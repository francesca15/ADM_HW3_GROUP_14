$298	2	Fredericksburg	October 2015	This wonderful house was built in the late 1800's. Although it has been modernized it still has the charm of that time. It is located at the edge of town on over an acre with a huge old oak tree in the front and lots of pecan trees in the back. The walk to town is easy either down Main Street or one street over on Austin Street where you can walk and view many cute guest houses and homes. Please note that the stairs to the upstairs bedroom are steep.	30.2879050960773	-98.8883449038569	Ancient Oak German GuestHouse built in 1870	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14948444?location=Center%20Point%2C%20TX
