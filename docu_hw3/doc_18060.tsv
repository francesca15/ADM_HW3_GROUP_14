Tennis courts, pool and Clubhouse about 20 minutes from Dallas Galleria Mall. Beautiful quiet neighborhood! Close to Lake Lewisville. I'm about 40 min. from Ft. Worth.

If you are a music lover, UNT puts out some of the best musicians. They are famous for that! Catch some great players playing around town. I can tell you the best clubs and places to eat. Come for the Jazz and Blues festivals. Check out UNT and TWU if you are moving a student here. Make yourself at home. I have a combo mountain/street bike. There are bike trails close and there is the trail on the Green belt about 15 miles near Lake Ray Roberts. If you need to do business from here, I have wireless and and office area. You can expect some peace and quite. If you need to work out, I have a universal gym and since I do massage professionally, that is available, as well for a discounted rate.	33.1479653576005	-97.08622538465859	Home in Denton 27 min.
