$129	Studio	Bryan	August 2016	My place is close to Texas A&amp;M University, many restaurants and main thoroughfares. Variety of shops also within 5-7 minute drive. Youâ€™ll love my place because of our quiet, private location that's centrally located in the middle of the Bryan/College Station. Wake up to trees, not traffic! We aim to show our guests the hospitality that Aggieland is famous for while respecting your privacy. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).	30.6401560711242	-96.32862768707291	Rosemary Studio Apartment Hideaway	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14473666?location=Caldwell%2C%20TX
