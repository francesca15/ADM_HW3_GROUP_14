$70	1	Nacogdoches	August 2016	Our cabin is about 150 feet from our home.  We are located in the Woden community, which is about a ten minute drive from Nacogdoches. Well worth the ten minute drive to be in tall trees and a Zen kind of place.	31.513726876300396	-94.5325675571037	A moment of zen	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14783130?location=Center%2C%20TX
