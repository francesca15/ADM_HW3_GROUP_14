$59	1	Irving	April 2014	I have a 2 stories 2/2.5 bedroom/bathroom in a gated community with a pool and gym. The room has a queen-sized bed and a full-sized futon, however the couch downstairs is also available for the fifth if necessary. It is located on the second floor up a flight of stairs so it is not wheelchair accessible. I will no longer be accepting reservations more that 45 days ahead.	32.8621856973137	-96.95249270169	Great Location, Pleasant Stay	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7806446?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
