$75	1	Dallas	July 2016	Great apt in Uptown, Dallas. Walking distance to restaurants, bars, American Airlines Center, &amp; adjacent to the Katy Trail and McKinney Ave. Parking spaces available in covered, underground parking garage. Washer &amp; dryer in unit. Prefer quiet guests because my unit is right next to the leasing office. Uptown is a busy neighborhood, and my unit windows face the street, so some street noise is unavoidable, sorry! Great option for 1 or 2 guests, but 3 is definitely a crowd! Happy vacay, y'all!	32.802173482063	-96.80501379710579	Uptown - Carlisle Street	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17012962?location=Coppell%2C%20TX
