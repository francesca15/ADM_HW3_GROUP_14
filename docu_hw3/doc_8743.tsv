$85	2	San Antonio	May 2016	My place is close to Lackland AFB and Sea World. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the comfy beds, the coziness, easy access to Lackland AFB (if your kid/friend/family member is graduating) My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets). House is located on a quiet cul-de-sac, and is very peaceful at night.	29.421610110762302	-98.64031683497049	Charming spacious home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17406840?location=Castroville%2C%20TX
