$89	2	Cisco	June 2016	This Camper overlooks the historic A-frame cabins of Lake Cisco. These cabins have always been a great historic icon to Lake Cisco. We purchased this property February of 2016 with a goal of restoring the whole facility. Since the purchase we have made lots of progress and will continue to move forward restoring &amp; modernizing the cabins! Our future plans also include having a store for bait, sporting goods and all your lakeside needs!	32.4365956758632	-99.0058570259846	The Captain's Camper @ Lake Cisco Rentals	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16947212?location=Cisco%2C%20TX
