$200	2	Smithville	August 2014	We wanted a place where the kids could run around, play games, kayak, go fishing, relax in the river, make smores or sleep under the stars, so the Shack was born. We've kept it simple. Hope you enjoy!	30.02229705763	-97.1702237721413	Cabin on the Colorado in Smithville	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4112631?location=Bastrop%20County%2C%20TX
