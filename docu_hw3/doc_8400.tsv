$170	Studio	Wimberley	December 2016	Nestled on the edge of a cliff at the top of one of Wimberley’s tallest hills this secluded cabin provides one of the best views in the area. Relax on the front porch stargazing under the huge Texas Sky and spend a lazy morning in the cozy handmade queen size bed.  My place is close to art and culture, and restaurants and dining. You’ll love my place because of the outdoors space, the comfy bed, and the light. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and furry friends (pets).	30.035973135907803	-98.09864479268141	Eagle Ridge Cabin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16826139?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
