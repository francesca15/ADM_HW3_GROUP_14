$77	1	Corpus Christi	February 2015	This unit is located downtown in the Nueces Lofts. It's a clean flat with a full sized bed, and walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, bars and the beach (exactly 1 mile from Mcgee Beach). This is my second listing and this place is airb&amp;b only, noone lives here. The unit has some cooking utensils (not for a huge dinner) and a coffee maker. We do supply a few coffee pods and coffee, but you may prefer your own.	27.797513047325502	-97.39418440012942	DOWNTOWN LOFT NEAR BEACH	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7420653?location=Corpus%20Christi%2C%20TX
