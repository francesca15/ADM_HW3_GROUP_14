$69	1	Austin	November 2015	We are close to downtown and near many Austin attractions. Our house is nestled on a culdesac in a southwest neighborhood, a stone's throw away to shopping, Valentino's BBQ, and Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center. We offer comfortable and private accommodations. Queen size bed. Art lovers and musicians welcome! Enjoy an evening relaxing on the deck, taking a dip in the pool, or just to unwinding after a fun day. Did we mention cats? We have a few who would love you, too!
