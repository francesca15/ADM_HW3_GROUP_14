$120	2	Houston	August 2016	My place is close to Downtown, Midtown, The Heights, White Oak Music Hall and St. Arnold's Brewery. It's 1 block off the METRORail (to NRG Stadium). It's close to major freeways and is centrally located between both Houston airports. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location, comfortable beds, decor, the spacious patio with a downtown view. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids).	29.7753381537787	-95.363004201908	Cozy Home a Block from the METRORail	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16636035?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
