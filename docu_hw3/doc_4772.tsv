$280	1	Houston	January 2017	My place is close to Downtown. It's only minutes away from George R. Brown Convention Center, Minute Maid Park, Toyota Center, BBVA Compass Stadium and Houston night life.  Youâ€™ll love my place because it's in a quiet community tucked away east of Downtown. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.  There is plenty of room to park and Uber makes it easy to get around the city if you're not bringing a car. There's also public transportation around town.	29.7492208966213	-95.31912727432751	Superbowl Ready!
