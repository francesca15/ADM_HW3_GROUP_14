$50	1	Austin	June 2014	We live in a 3 bedroom apartment off of Parmer Ln between I35 and Mopac (Loop 1). The complex itself is very family and grad student oriented, and we are about a 7 minute drive to The Domain ($7 - 10 ride share). About 20 minutes from downtown ($20 ride share). I am a 25 year old writer and I work from home, so I am usually around, and have a small dog by the name of Gatsby who is honestly barely noticeable. He's a shy one. Feel free to message me anytime if you have any questions! :]	30.4124064579128	-97.69362128892558	Cozy Colorful Room by The Domain!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17514673?location=Coupland%2C%20TX
