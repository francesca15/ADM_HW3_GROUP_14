$75	1	San Antonio	May 2016	My place is close to Downtown and the Pearl Brewery, the airport, the city center, art and culture, and many amazing restaurants. The river walk is at the end of the street a block away. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the proximity to the river walk and the historical neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	29.444041226585302	-98.486097769781	The Yellow Room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14180481?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
