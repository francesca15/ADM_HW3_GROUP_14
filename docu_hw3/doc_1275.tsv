$350	Studio	Corpus Christi	April 2016	When you arrive, you'll see your set up, complete with an elevated floor ( less sand gets in ) piled with a rug and pillows for a soft, relaxed day. Outside, relax in your stylish beach chairs, sipping a flavored water, or your own beverage you choose to bring. Listen to your tunes on a bluetooth speaker while watching the waves until it's time to light the fire and cuddle up. After you're all set, simply text us that you're leaving and we'll clean it all up for you.	27.583805380176603	-97.2189744681397	Day/Evening Rental for Beach Teepee in Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17611067?location=Baffin%20Bay%2C%20TX
