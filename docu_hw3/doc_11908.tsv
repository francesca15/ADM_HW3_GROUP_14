$35	Studio	New Braunfels	July 2016	It is quiet here and very peaceful. A place to really clear your mind. This is a 1 acre campsite. A great place to come after a day on the Guadalupe River, which is just a few miles away. Raw land. No house. There is electric. And if I get enough interest I will get the water turned on.	29.8432916707806	-98.14027556722121	1 Acre Camping with Electric off River Road	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18902159?location=Canyon%20Lake%2C%20TX
