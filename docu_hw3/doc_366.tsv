$60	1	Bryan	November 2016	My place is close to family-friendly activities, the airport, public transport, and nightlife. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the people, the ambiance, and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). We have two small extremely friendly dogs and one small cuddly cat.	30.7173195027909	-96.37642964017121	The Pink Room	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15790261?location=Bryan%2C%20TX
