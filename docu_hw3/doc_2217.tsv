$129	2	The Woodlands	February 2015	My modern two bedroom apartment is the ideal set-up for anyone traveling to Houston and looking for a location near The Woodlands.  If you're looking to catch a concert, my place is absolutely perfect because you can literally WALK to the Cynthia Woods Pavilion.  You'll have no problems getting around to the malls, shops and restaurants nearby.  So get ready. Because once you stay in this apartment, you won't want to leave. But is that such a bad thing? No, not at all :)	30.156704516090603	-95.4598825401988	CLASSY Woodlands Apartment Just Waiting For You :)	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16570963?location=Conroe%2C%20TX
