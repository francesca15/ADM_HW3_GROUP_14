$150	1	Boerne	June 2016	My place is close to great views, restaurants and dining, family-friendly activities, and nightlife. Youâ€™ll love my place because of Historic 4 acre country setting inside Boerne's city limits, the views, the people. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), big groups, and furry friends (pets).	29.760544100994895	-98.706475798731	Texan House	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13309292?location=Boerne%2C%20TX
