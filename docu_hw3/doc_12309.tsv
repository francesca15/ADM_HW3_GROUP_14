$90	2	San Antonio	July 2016	Our house is close to the city center. It's a very quiet, working class neighborhood just minutes from the Alamo, the River Walk, the Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center and the Institute of Texas Cultures. We are close to the ATT Center for major entertainment acts as well as the San Antonio Spurs. We are a few blocks off of Interstate 10 so we can also provide a quiet, comfortable place to rest and recuperate before your next road adventure.	29.3942532908304	-98.4648715690098	Charming Bungalow/The Tortoise and Hare	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15741826?location=Bulverde%2C%20TX
