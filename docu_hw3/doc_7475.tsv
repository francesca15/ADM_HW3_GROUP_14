$19	1	Cedar Park	April 2016	Sure, it's a garage, but it's a pretty pimped out garage as garages go. Window unit for A/C, heater, mini fridge, TV with all the sports channels, and a space heater. If you like the smell of lawnmower oil and freshly cut grass, even better.	30.471264624286498	-97.8337250822912	Cot in my garage	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12600610?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
