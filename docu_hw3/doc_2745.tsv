$45	1	Lewisville	June 2016	We are a gay couple with two dogs. We are first time home owners and want to earn some extra money to put into our new humble abode. During the week we both work.   Our place is close to restaurants and dining and public transport. Youâ€™ll love our place because of the zen ambiance and outdoor pool. Our place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	33.0782075898068	-97.02908270379992	Lewisville/Highland Village area Oasis-Getaway	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17347378?location=Corinth%2C%20TX
