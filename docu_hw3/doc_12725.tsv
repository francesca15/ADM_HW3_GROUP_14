$49	1	Fort Worth	August 2013	If you're like us, friendly Canadians, you just need a nice place to stay, not an expensive one. We have a nice sized house with an empty upstairs bedroom just waiting for you. Our modern four-bedroom house was built in 2010. The house is open and airy; the bedroom has a nice double size bed and full bath just outside the door. The bathroom is shared with two teenagers, but very clean. Towels and sheets provided.   Kitchen and living room are common areas. We have DVD, Xbox, washer &amp; dryer, iron and ironing board. Back patio backs up to the greenbelt, very peaceful to read or drink your morning coffee; we also have an outdoor grill for your use.  We are located just off I-35 &amp; 114 in North Fort Worth, 15 minutes from Cabelas and Alliance Airport, 5 minutes from Texas Motor Speedway (practically across from the TMS), 25 minutes from downtown Fort Worth, 20 minutes from Southlake, 25 minutes from Grapevine Mills Mall &amp; Bass Pro, 30 minutes from DFW airport.   We are easy to stay with, promise you won't go hungry with an assortment of breakfast goodies and a great cup of coffee. High speed internet (18 Mbps) and Wi-Fi are necessary parts of life and we have both.  Roxie, our hypoallergenic shorkie loves company. We are a Christian family, who does not drink, smoke or live loudly and we hope you will respect that.	33.024523194759695	-97.299889657705	Private bedroom in spacious home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1885626?location=Bridgeport%2C%20TX
