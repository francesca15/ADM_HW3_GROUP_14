$60	2	Houston	April 2015	I would love to host you at my remodeled 1950's style home. My place is close to I-45, 10 min from downtown and 15 min from the international airport. 5 min away you will find the best authentic Mexican food and souvenirs while listening/dancing to music. The north side of Houston is full of history and hidden gems. You can also use the location to explore the various attractions in the city. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets).	29.8631191670144	-95.40135575125791	Remodeled North Houston Home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15875070?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
