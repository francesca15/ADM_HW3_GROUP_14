$71	2	San Antonio	December 2012	Stay in a cozy bed and wake up to a glorious walk in McAllister Park, the largest park in the city of San Antonio. 3 miles from any type of retail store you might need, and we have quick highway access. Every evening you are guaranteed to see the neighborhood dear out and snacking, right now we have an adorable fawn. You have access to laundry and full kitchen and living room spaces, including backyard with a grill. I live here in the house; I'm quiet and accommodating.	29.5700114477895	-98.4485372678632	Comfy House by McAllister Park	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/840265?location=Converse%2C%20TX
