$31	1	Austin	November 2012	I was a host a few years back. I really enjoyed hosting people from all over the world. I also have stayed in many other host's homes. I love the AirBnB experience!   You are welcome to wash some clothes, or use the iron if you need to. You also are welcome to cook and eat here.    I travel a lot, but if I am home, I've always got coffee, herbal teas, and fresh organic food. If I have just made a fresh batch of organic spinach walnut pesto, I will share it with you!	30.4585785128981	-97.78440394784201	Private Room & Bathroom in Quiet Neighborhood	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17678915?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
