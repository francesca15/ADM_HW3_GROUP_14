$150	2	Galveston	May 2012	My place is close to a very nice beach - one block away. Youâ€™ll love my place because it is newly renovated and decorated with tastefully done beach theme, the people, the location-convenient part of Galveston. Restaurants, the Pleasure Pier, bars/clubs, bike rentals, and home tours all within walking distance. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets).	29.293639929806698	-94.78635617081609	Galveston Rentals	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14838819?location=Bayou%20Vista%2C%20TX
