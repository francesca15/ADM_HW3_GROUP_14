$77	2	Houston	February 2017	This is not a private rental. We actively live in our home and invite you to join us. Our home is a traditional 2-story with the bedrooms on the second floor, 14 steps up. Many rooms have color. They are not cookie cutter boring beige. One bedroom with two twin beds is pink and the other bedroom with a queen bed is blue. Each sleeps two people. The colors are tactful and tastefully done. Use the house and make it yours. The neighborhood is very well taken care and is a beautiful place to stay.	30.0394341289536	-95.22547734814529	Sleeps 4.
