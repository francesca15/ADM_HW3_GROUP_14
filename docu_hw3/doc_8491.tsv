$75	1	Austin	April 2013	Hello! My name is Lauren and I have a wonderful condo just north of downtown Austin in an awesome location off of Burnet and Anderson Lane. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and furry friends (pets). I'm currently staying in the living area but I'm either gone most of the day working / sometimes out of town. :)  I hope you come stay with me! I look forward to hopefully hosting/ meeting you! :)	30.346145426605396	-97.7360628422255	Private Room in Modern Condo in Central Austin	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1814977?location=Cedar%20Park%2C%20TX
