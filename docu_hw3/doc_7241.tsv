$45	1	Austin	March 2012	My partner and I live in a 3/2 in South Austin. Our neighborhood is full of families and is very safe and quiet. Your bedroom has a super comfy queen-sized bed, desk, walk-in closet and newly renovated private bathroom. We are very laid back and love recommending the best places to go in ATX, but we also respect your space and privacy. We have a 1-year-old baby who is the cutest and happiest baby on the planet and an adorable standard poodle. Fun fact- our home is powered by 100% wind energy!	30.1988237964562	-97.8170699341482	Quiet, family-friendly B&B w/ hot coffee in the AM	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/371626?location=Buda%2C%20TX
