$56	1	Grapevine	September 2014	The Tetons is less than one mile to Gaylord, two miles to down town Grapevine, and conveniently located between Dallas, Fort Worth. We are surrounded by restaurants, museums, parks, art &amp; culture. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the outdoors space, bike and hike trails, a four-minute walk to the lake, the tiny quiet neighborhood is tucked away from main streets, the comfy bed, your own bathroom, and kitchen privileges. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.	32.9583874261246	-97.0696914653276	The Tetons in Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14386500?location=Bedford%2C%20TX
