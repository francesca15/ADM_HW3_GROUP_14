$107	1	Galveston	May 2016	My place is very close to shopping , dining, and accessible to main streets. Youâ€™ll love my place because of The artistic decor, open floor plan, and expansive backyard. There is a pool and patio area that is a quiet evening to take in the sunset. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. This house especially welcomes those who want to unwind, detach from the city life, and live a slower pace during their visit.	29.2761992195647	-94.8389269404683	Island Oasis	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13152396?location=Bayou%20Vista%2C%20TX
