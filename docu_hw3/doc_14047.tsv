$75	1	San Leon	December 2015	Our Waterfront Room with View is a wonderful place for people that want privacy and relaxation. Sitting on Galveston Bay, at Eagle's Point. You can catch the morning sunrise from your private porch. There are many local restaurants and entertainment. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the outdoors space, the location, the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, adventurers, or business travelers.	29.4933894858282	-94.9101801330843	Waterfront Room With View San Leon Texas	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13263283?location=Beach%20City%2C%20TX
