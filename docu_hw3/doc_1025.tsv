$325	3	Crystal Beach	June 2015	My family has been coming to Crystal Beach for decades. In fact, the black and white photos in the house were taken on this very beach. I decided to name my home Riad by the Sea after the small, intimate hotels of Morocco called Riads. The name is a testament to my passion for travel and my passion for the ocean. I hope you will find it as magical as I do!	29.4723692997023	-94.5958699935953	Riad by the Sea	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18911829?location=Anahuac%2C%20TX
