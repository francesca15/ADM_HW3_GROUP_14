$65	1	Allen	March 2014	This charming home is near all the activities! The shopping, fabulous parks, indoor swim/water park, Hydros-wake park, The Edge-skate park, Cosmic Jump, and multiple sporting/concert events are all just minutes away. We are located in a family oriented city. I am near I-75, Hwy 121 is about 10 min away, and I-635 in Dallas is about 20 min from me. After a stressful day of activities, you can come home to swim in the pool or relax in the hot tub! For large families, I can open up other bed rooms.	33.0974517173588	-96.6305316861615	Private room w/pool, hot tub, full house access	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13624263?location=Allen%2C%20TX
