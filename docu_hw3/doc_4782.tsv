$45	1	Fort Worth	September 2016	My place is close to the airport and parks. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the light, the comfy bed, the kitchen, and the coziness. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. It offers a full size bed only, with a private bathroom!	32.841063972178695	-97.2261047316515	Freedom Home 2	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15486132?location=Colleyville%2C%20TX
