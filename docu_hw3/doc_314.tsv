$60	1	San Antonio	November 2011	Gorgeous vintage neighborhood full of gardens and elegant architecture. Located a few blocks from Trinity University, and across the highway from Incarnate Word University. It takes about a 5 min drive to get to the Pearl Brewery and downtown. We have Central Market, Trader Joe's and Whole foods within 5 minutes. Plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, and entertainment around the area. Very safe place and awesome neighbors.	29.4646439674577	-98.488605722588	Beautiful Vintage Apartment	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13827621?location=Alamo%20Heights%2C%20TX
