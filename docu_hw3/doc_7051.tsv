$90	1	Houston	August 2012	If you are looking for a peaceful get away in the heart of Montrose then you have found it! Our house is situated in Mandell Place, you will be minutes from the hippest bars, cafes, food trucks and shopping in MONTROSE. We are biking distance to Memorial park and Highland Village.
