$95	1	Houston	August 2015	My place is close to restaurants and dining and family-friendly activities. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the outdoors space, the neighborhood, and the light. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. The Heights is such a great community and the bike path goes on for miles, you can walk to great restaurants or parks. This place is a 10 minute drive to Downtown Houston. Also convenient access to Katy Fwy (I-10). Easily get to the Galleria area in 10 minutes.	29.784539538522	-95.40224405641159	Fabulous apartment ~ convenient location	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14630354?location=Atascocita%2C%20TX
