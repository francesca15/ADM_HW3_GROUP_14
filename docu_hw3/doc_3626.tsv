$100	1	Canton	October 2016	Our place is new, built in Spring of 2016 and close to the intersection of Hwy 19 and FM 858. We are away from the city, just 10 miles south of Canton. Youâ€™ll love this place because of the peaceful atmosphere. It is serene here with 40 acres, a pond, creek, and a few cows. It's a nice getaway or for Canton Trade Days. Our place is great for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families (with kids). There are a lot of things to do in our area.
