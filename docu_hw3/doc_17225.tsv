$70	1	Dallas	June 2011	It's seriously awesome, it's way cool, and it's where you should stay when in D. My place is in one of Dallas' best neighborhoods, close to the pulse of the city. You get a whole wing of the house - be as social or private as you like.	32.8170495825228	-96.7360747969816	Way-Cool by the Lake 2.0 2 Rooms!	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1948009?location=Balch%20Springs%2C%20TX
