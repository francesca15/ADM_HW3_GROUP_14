$50	1	Austin	February 2016	Greetings guest! My home is located in the beautiful golf course community of Falconhead, roughly 30 minutes northwest of downtown Austin in what's known as the 'hill country'. There is one guest bedroom available and a private bathroom. A quaint pavilion/pool is 25' from my front door, and the Hill Country Galleria (high-end shops and lots of great local eateries) is about 10 minutes away.	30.318324912613804	-97.9703653357335	Quaint Mediterranean-style home	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19099760?location=Bee%20Cave%2C%20TX
