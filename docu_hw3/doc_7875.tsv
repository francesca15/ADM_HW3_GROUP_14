$250	1	College Station	January 2016	My place is close to Texas A&amp;M University, Kyle Field, Reed Arena, Blue Bell Park and Peach Creek Ranch Wedding Venue. It is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers.  Please note bedroom is upstairs. Listed as available for children 2-12 y/o, but because of the weights in the gym and the water risk, would feel more comfortable if children were a little older (maybe 8 &amp; older) and can swim	30.496997696902397	-96.29013175335061	Guest Apt in South College Station	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14780240?location=Caldwell%2C%20TX
