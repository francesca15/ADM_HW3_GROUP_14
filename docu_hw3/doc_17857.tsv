$120	1	Denton	April 2014	The space you'll be in is a 2bed 2bath apartment built in the 70's located in the ashram. The room you'll be in will belong to me, one of the tenants of the apartment. I have an interest in vintage design/fashion and I love all of my decor pieces so please take good care of the room! There's a record player and bluetooth speaker in the room you can use as well. You'll have your own private bath and you're welcome to use any of the essentials, if you have any questions feel free to ask!	33.2202196052148	-97.13355070648849	Cozy Mid-Century Magic Den	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16393906?location=Aubrey%2C%20TX
