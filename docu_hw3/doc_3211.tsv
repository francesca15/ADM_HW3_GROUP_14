$129	4	Denton	September 2015	The Denton Downtown Square, UNT, and TWU are just a few minutes drive away. My place is also close to several good parks. Youâ€™ll love my place because of the location and the nice neighborhood. My place is great for parents visiting UNT or TWU with or without their student, business travelers, and families with kids. Denton has many great places to visit, but is also a great location to stay for visiting sites in Dallas or Fort Worth.	33.220422668457104	-97.1066648707391	Home away from Home close to UNT/TWU/35	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8426768?location=Corinth%2C%20TX
