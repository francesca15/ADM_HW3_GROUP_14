$130	1	Austin	January 2012	Small (500 square feet), updated condo in small, quiet complex. The building is located right between the University of Texas campus and the state capitol on a lovely, tree lined street. Everything that downtown has to offer is right outside your door but the neighborhood is quiet, lined with many old homes that are now used for commercial purposes.  The condo has a studio setup with the bedroom being open to the living area. All of the units (18 total) in the building have been upgraded and they boast bamboo flooring, granite counters in the kitchen and bathroom, stainless steel appliances and new plumbing fixtures. There is a laundry room on each floor with top of the line appliances that are free to use. There are several restaurants, bars, museums and shops in the immediate vicinity and it is an easy walk to most other places downtown. There is free parking underneath the building.  Note: By accepting the terms of AirBnB, the guests also assume the risk of all harm and or injury which may occur to the guests on the premises or use of facilities. The guest releases and holds the host harmless of any and all liability.  As much or as little as they would like.  Very centrally located between the University of Texas and downtown. You can walk south down Nueces through the old residential part of Austin and will be at 6th Street in about 15 minutes. Cross MLK to the north and you are on the UT campus in five minutes. Arturos on San Antonio on 17th is great for breakfast and lunch, Clay Pit for Indian and the Dive Bar for drinks are all two blocks to the east.
