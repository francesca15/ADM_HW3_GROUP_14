$65	1	Bryan	July 2016	We live in an apartment in Bryan, Texas two miles away from Kyle Field. This is a quiet area away from the noise and traffic of Northgate and campus, however is still in very close proximity to drive to campus, or even walk, ride a bike, or take a bus (we are right near a bus route as well).  We have fast wireless internet, a TV and Wii U, various kitchen appliances for cooking, and a spacious living room. There is a front porch, as well as a back porch with a grill on it.	30.6291065099488	-96.3644560901665	Quiet, cozy apartment near Texas A&M & Kyle Field	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13996343?location=Caldwell%2C%20TX
