$19	1	Fort Worth	September 2015	Enjoy a private room with a comfortable, king-sized bed and a guest bathroom just down the hallway.    Your room is separated from the Master, providing privacy when needed. Only a 15-minute drive from downtown Fort Worth, Stockyards, and Magnolia. We're off of I-20 so you'll be near TCU, Hulen Mall, and plenty of restaurants/shopping!  We have one hypoallergenic puppy named Ballot. He's a friendly little guy but we can be sure to keep him out of your way, too.	32.6566525450728	-97.36947107788392	The Cowtown Room - Private, Cozy Bedroom	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15546284?location=Burleson%2C%20TX
