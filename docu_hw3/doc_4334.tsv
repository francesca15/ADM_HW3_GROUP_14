$49	1	Conroe	April 2016	Steven's Lair is a 4 room B &amp; B located 6 miles from The Woodlands Mall and the twin office towers of ExxonMobil Hughes Landing. We're not typical frou-frou. Rather we are welcoming, comfortable, and practical. Our vibe leans suitably business masculine, then we stirred in a little fun. Stephen’s Lair is part Bed &amp; Breakfast Inn, part health club, part Grandma's house, and a dash of spending the night on the couch in your buddy’s man cave. Take a look, we just might be your kind of place.	30.217869089246502	-95.4278874186985	Steven's Lair B&B, The Woodlands, Sailing Guest Rm	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/17304779?location=Conroe%2C%20TX
