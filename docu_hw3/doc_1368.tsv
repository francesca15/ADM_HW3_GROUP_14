$110	2	Galveston	May 2017	Quiet island getaway tucked into an established residential neighborhood.  Great place to explore the Island or BBQ, enjoying the sea breeze in the lush fenced backyard. A few blocks to the beach and a couple miles to all that Historic Downtown has to offer.   This place really has all the amenities you will not find in a hotel; beach towels, coolers, chairs, bicycles, etc. Furnished with many locally procured artwork and furniture. A real home for you to relax in and enjoy your stay.	29.2782704927875	-94.8127558658112	Beach Bound	https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18775667?location=Bayou%20Vista%2C%20TX
